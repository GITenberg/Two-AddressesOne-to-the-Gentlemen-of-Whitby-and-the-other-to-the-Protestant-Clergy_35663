<h2>DEDICATION.</h2>


<p class="hangindent"><i>The following pages are humbly, and gratefully Dedicated, to
the Catholic Noblemen and Gentlemen of Yorkshire, by the
Catholic Priest at Ugthorp.</i></p>

<p class="gap2 smcap">Noblemen and Gentlemen,</p>

<p>Many of you, lately appeared boldly, and manfully on the
platform at York, in defence of our holy religion. Conscious
of the justice and innocence of our cause, you feared neither the
sneers, nor the insults, nor the shouts, nor the threats of its enemies,
but, like your illustrious ancestors, shewed that you considered
your religion, as your best inheritance, and held it more dear than
life itself; whilst, on the other hand, like your illustrious ancestors,
you shewed that you yielded <i>to none</i>, in <i>your loyal allegiance</i> to
your <i>temporal</i> sovereign, and to the state. Now it would be
ungrateful, nay even base, in us Catholic clergymen, not to second
your manly, and zealous exertions in defence of our ancient, and
holy faith. To you, therefore, I most humbly, and gratefully
dedicate the following pages. I hope you will find, that I have
not advanced in them, anything that is inconsistent with the principles
of truth, of justice, and of honour. To have acted otherwise,
would, I am sure (for I have the honour to be personally acquainted
with most of you), be most insulting to your noble, and liberal
feelings, and would only have served, to confirm the hostility of
the Protestant, and to loosen the attachment of the Catholic, to
that cause, which I had undertaken to defend.</p>

<p>Noblemen, and Gentlemen, when the Catholic looks back on
the <i>past</i>, he will learn to hope well of the <i>future</i>. He will observe,
that the irritating objections of former times, are now almost shamed
out of Parliament, and can hardly support their credit, even among
the most suspicious, and least informed Protestants. He will see,
that our opponents have uniformly been compelled, to shift their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
ground from position to position, and after pertinaciously defending
each, have ended by abandoning <i>it</i>, and retreating to <i>another</i>. At
first, the Catholics were accused of favouring the claims of the
Stuarts, but the extinction of that family, has put an end to that
charge. We were then told, that the Catholics, could not be bound
<i>by oath</i>, though <i>oaths</i>, had been wisely devised as the <i>best safeguards</i>,
against their supposed perfidy. Next, the fathers of the
great Council of Latern, were marshalled against us; as if men
were to be punished at the <i>present</i> day, because Protestants will
not understand the regulations of feudal Princes, and feudal Prelates
<i>six centuries ago</i>. Afterwards, we were reproached with the deposing
powers, and temporal pretensions of the Pope; these were
set at rest at <i>that time</i> (and we had hoped <i>for ever</i>,) by the answers
of the foreign Universities. Lastly, came the Coronation Oath,
men, however, could not be persuaded that the Sovereign, by promising
to maintain the liberties of the Protestant Church, was
bound to deprive of their civil rights all those, who might dissent
from the spiritual creed of that Church. Each of these arguments
in its day, was deemed <i>unanswerable</i>, but <i>each</i> has <i>yielded to discussion</i>.
<i>Past</i> advantages, therefore, Noblemen and Gentlemen,
are an earnest to the Catholic of <i>future</i> success; and after the
hour of the late excitement, about the Pope's temporal and spiritual
power, has passed away, I am sure, all sensible, and unbiassed
Englishmen will see, that the late hubbub, has been an <i>ignus
fatuus</i> of imaginations distorted with fear, and alarm, which had
well nigh, misled the whole nation, into a quagmire of inconsistency,
illiberality and revolution.</p>

<h3 class="gap2"><a name="TO_THE_READER" id="TO_THE_READER"></a>TO THE READER.</h3>


<p>Reader, that you may the better understand the two following
addresses, you ought <i>first</i>, to read the copy of the requisition for
the meeting, &amp;c., which is placed before these two addresses, and
you ought also, to read the little address which here follows,
and which I published to announce, that the following pages would
shortly appear in print. In the notice of the requisition for the
public meeting, &amp;c., you will find these words, "extraordinary and
presumptuous movement on the part of the Pope." Now, reader,
you must remember, that these memorable words are my grand text,
in the two following addresses. I here beg to offer my sincere
thanks to the gentlemen, who signed the requisition, for I am sure,
if they had studied from the deluge until now, they could not have
given me, a more suitable text for the Catholic cause, and a more
destructive one to the Protestant Church. But, reader, you will be
able to judge of this yourself, after reading the following pages.
Read first then, the following little address, and then read the
notice calling the public meeting.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p class="hangindent"><i>In the press, and in the course of a few weeks will be published,
an Address to the Gentlemen who signed the late Requisition
to the Magistrates of Whitby, to call a Public Meeting
to address the Queen on the late extraordinary and presumptuous
movement on the part of the Bishop of Rome.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">To the Inhabitants of Whitby and of the Neighbourhood.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inhabitants</span>,</p>

<p>I have been lately often asked, why I did not attend the
above meeting? I reply, read my address when it is published,
and you will there find an answer to your question. It is a common
observation of sailors, "only give the ship plenty of sea-room in
a storm, and then she will live." Now, inhabitants of Whitby, and
of the neighbourhood, if you will give the Catholic Church (or,
if you please, the Roman Catholic Church) only the sea-room of
fair play, you will, perhaps, find that the bottom and sides of
this spiritual ship, are well coppered with the solid, and impenetrable
metal of good reasons, and solid arguments, and that, full rigged
as she is, with the sails of truth, of justice, and of honour, she
can gallantly brave the hurricanes of her enemies, and ride triumphantly,
amid the storms of spiritual and temporal agitation, which
have lately threatened to shipwreck, and to sink her.</p>

<p>When my address appears, I hope you will find in it, nothing that
is inconsistent with principles of truth, of justice, and of honour.
To have used any other weapons of defence would, in my humble
opinion, have served only to strengthen the Protestant hostility,
and to loosen the Catholic attachment, to that cause, which I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
undertaken to defend. You will, of course, expect a little of the
comic, as coming from my pen, well, as the poet says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Ridentum dicere verum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quid vetat?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Or, that I may not speak in a foreign tongue, "What forbids us to
tell the truth, with a smile?"</p>

<p>Of course you will perhaps expect a little innocent stir, among the
Reverends in my address, and <i>perhaps</i>, you may not be mistaken.
If you remember, an <i>illuminated</i> Cambridge Divine, some years
ago, came to Lythe, to make an "extraordinary and presumptuous
movement" on the consciences of us Romanists, (as he politely styled
us), and learnedly informed us, that we Romanists, were a set of
spiritual chickens just hatching, and that he came to break our
spiritual shells, that he might save the young birds, from being
thrown into the scorching flames of Purgatory in the next world,
but while the courteous Clerk, was performing this charitable office,
to the benighted Romanists, <i>he</i>, <i>himself</i>, unfortunately, even in this
world, fell into the flames of purgatory, which on this side the grave
are made to burn, for those who bear false witness, against their
neighbour; and it is generally believed, that he has never as yet
been able to raise, from public opinion, as much money as will free
him, from those torturing purgatorial flames. Oh, but you will
naturally say, this is an old song, what has it to do with the present
subject? Why, it has a great deal to do with it. Certain Reverends
have been lately telling you, that the Pope of Rome, has just
made a most "extraordinary and presumptuous movement," on the
Protestants of England. Now you will perhaps find, from my
Address, when published, that even <i>these</i> very Reverends themselves
have been making, for a long time, a most "extraordinary and
presumptuous movement" on the pockets and on the intellects of
Englishmen; and have thus, like the <i>illuminated</i> Cambridge divine,
unfortunately fallen into the very pit, which they have been so
very charitably, and officiously digging for the <i>poor</i> Pope.</p>

<p>Sensible Englishmen, when these Reverends, would uncharitably
excite you against your long much injured, and unjustly abused
Catholic fellow creatures, just say to them, "Reverend gentlemen,
you tell us that the Scripture (the book of eternal life and of truth),
teaches <span class="smcap">Charity to all Men</span>! why, therefore, should you wish us
to exclude the <i>Catholics</i> from a share of that <i>universal</i> Charity?"
And in the next place tell them, "the Pope and all his spiritual
crew are either from God or not: if they are not from God, all
their human, and popish inventions will come of themselves to
naught, and why, therefore, should you wish us Protestants, to
break our charitable heads about <i>them</i>. But if they are from God,
how can either you or we fight against them, unless you arrogantly
presume, that you can conquer the Almighty! At least, so teaches
the sacred Scripture, for does it not thus plainly, and emphatically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
say, 'And now therefore I say to you, refrain from these men, and
let them alone, for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will
come to naught; but if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it, lest
perhaps you be found even to fight against God.'" (Acts v. 38, 39.)</p>

<p>As I have been obliged to range in my address, over an extensive
<i>spiritual</i> and <i>temporal</i> moor, and as I have had to bring down,
and bag so much black game, of course my Address, will be of
rather an extensive nature. It is, indeed, now in the press, but of
course its appearance will, in some measure, depend upon the
expedition of the printer, but I will promise you, that it shall be got
out of the printer's hands <i>as soon as possible</i>, and then, it must
appeal to the judgments of sensible and unbiassed minds, as to its
merits, and demerits. In the mean time, as Englishmen always
wish to know the text, I will give you the two texts, which I
have chosen for the titlepage of my Address.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I would you had been there to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the light blazed up so gloriously."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"And then in naked Majesty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With brow serene, and beaming placid light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came truth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Inhabitants, in conclusion, I confidently appeal to you, if you
ever knew me do an ungenteel act to any Protestant in point
of religion. I have always wished equal rights and equal justice
for all, both for Protestants and Dissenters; I have always wished
to live in peace and charity with all; in short, I have always
endeavoured to observe, as far as my human weakness would allow,
that heavenly precept of our divine Saviour, "By this shall all men
know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love for one another;"
and I can confidently appeal to the public, if this has not always
been the tenor of my conduct. I assure you, that it is very contrary
to my wishes, to have to appear before you, with my pen
on these occasions. Among the Protestants I have many sincere
friends, and of course, what I shall have to advance in my Address,
may not be very agreeable to their feelings. But as I really know,
and conscientiously believe, that the Church, of which I have the
honour to be a minister, is really the true Church of Christ, to
shrink from its defence for the sake of private feelings, and private
interests, would, in my ideas, be a most base and an unchristian act
on my part. I exclaim with the poet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A day, an hour of virtuous liberty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is worth a whole eternity in bondage."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Farewell, inhabitants, for the present, and if, when my Address
appears before the public, you would like to have a little <i>innocent</i>
merriment, and to hear some plain homely truths, I hope you will
not be disappointed if you purchase my Address.</p>

<p>We, the undersigned Magistrates, present at a Petty Session, held
at the Justice Room, Whitby, this 23rd day of November,
1850, do hereby give notice, that a Public Meeting of the
Inhabitants of the Town and Neighbourhood of Whitby, will
be held, in compliance with the above Requisition, in the Town
Hall, at Whitby, on Thursday, the 28th instant, at Twelve
o'clock at noon.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ADDRESS" id="THE_ADDRESS"></a>THE ADDRESS.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,</p>

<p>The copy of a notice on the preceding page, shows
that you thought proper to call a public meeting, for the purposes
expressed in that bill. Now do not suppose for one moment, that I
wish to question either the right, or the propriety of calling such a
meeting. If our Protestant countrymen choose to call, and hold
meetings for the purpose of expressing their sentiments on any
public question, they have certainly, a right to do so, and also a
right to the free expression of their sentiments on those occasions.
But, gentlemen, have not <i>we Catholics</i> also an <i>equal</i> right, to express
<i>our</i> sentiments on those subjects. That a regular opposition to the
Catholics, has been lately organized, must be evident to the most
inattentive observer. The clergy, and the head of the government,
have been placed in the front of the battle, and with cry of danger
to the <i>Church</i>, has been coupled that of danger to the <i>Constitution</i>.
In aid of these efforts, the press also, has been put in requisition,
and the labours of anti-catholic journalists, and the diffusion of
anti-catholic tracts, published in every shape, and adapted to every
understanding, bear ample testimony to the zeal, and activity of
those, who assume the lead in this anti-catholic crusade. We are
doomed to hear daily, our religion traduced, our spiritual but
illustrious Head, bespattered with the most vile abuse, our civil
liberty menaced, our Clergy threatened with pains, and penalties,
our most sacred rites most contumaciously designated by the first
minister of the Crown as mummeries, and the Lord High Chancellor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
vaunting his readiness to trample, on the mitres of our bishops.
Gentlemen, I think it cannot be expected that we Catholics, should
remain <i>silent</i>, and humble our heads before this whirlwind of Protestant
intolerance, and that, imitating the stupidity of the Ostrich,
we should endeavour to escape our hunters, by concealing our heads.
But, gentlemen, you may perhaps ask, why did you not attend our
public meeting? I reply, I did not hear of your meeting until a day
after it had been held, but if I had <i>heard</i> of it <i>before</i>, I should not
have attended for the following reasons. Meetings that are convened
by one party, are generally <i>packed</i> meetings, called under the excitement
of the moment, and the audience in general are unwilling to
listen to fair play, or to the arguments of their opponents. This
was evident from your meeting, for had it not been for the honest,
and liberal conduct of your chairman, Christopher Richardson, Esq.,
Mr. Taylerson, though not a Catholic, would not have obtained a
hearing, and how were his sensible questions answered? By shouts,
and hisses. But, gentlemen, I have another reason for not attending.
Each nation, like each individual, has a certain character,
and temperament. Now, whoever will deliberately consider the
character, and temperament of Englishmen, will find, that when
they are once roused, and excited, they are then unwilling to listen,
either to reason or argumentation, but let the heat of excitement
pass away, and let the cooler moments of reflection return, and <i>then</i>,
you may appeal to them with propriety, and advantage. It is very
imprudent and foolish for a wife to expostulate, and argue with her
drunken husband, but let the moments of sobriety return, and then,
her reasonable, and prudent expostulations, may be attended with
salutary effects. For these reasons, gentlemen, I did not attend
your public meeting.</p>

<p>But you will say, why do you address us in particular? Why,
gentlemen, I cannot for a moment suppose that when you are cool,
and unexcited, you are so wedded to your own opinions, and so deaf
to the claims of fair play, as to be unwilling to listen to the arguments
of the <i>accused</i>. Surely you do not wish to trample down the
accused, <i>unheard!</i> If you do, I really think it is a very "extraordinary,
and presumptuous movement" on your part, and I am sure
every sensible and honest Englishman will think the same.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, then, gentlemen, let us now come to the point in question.
I begin by asking the very sensible, and rational question, which Mr.
Taylerson put to your meeting. What aggression have the Pope
and Dr. Wiseman committed? What English Law have they transgressed?
If any, why not let the law be calmly and quietly enforced
against them? But if they have broken no law, why all this fury,
and tirade against them as if they had? Oh, but, replied a certain
influential gentleman, at your meeting, "If there is not a law, there
must be one made." I answer, that the principle of self-defence
will, in cases of real danger, authorize the adoption of lawful precautions,
I am not disposed to deny; but, then, those precautions
must be founded <i>on equity</i>; they must be such as <i>reason</i> will justify,
or <i>necessity</i> excuse. You are not to invade the rights or privileges
of others, on the <i>bare suspicion</i> of <i>future</i> danger or the <i>mere</i> possibility
of a possibility. You are not to cane a man at Lady-day,
because he may affront you at Midsummer. If you think the contrary,
I must, gentlemen, candidly tell you, it is a very "extraordinary,
and presumptuous movement" on your part, against the
rights and privileges of your fellow creatures, and if any Magistrate,
were to advance such extraordinary opinions, in a court of justice, I
feel confident, every sensible and honest Englishman would deeply
feel the propriety, of presenting an address to Her Majesty, or to
Her Ministers, on so "extraordinary, and presumptuous a movement"
on the part of that Magistrate, against the rights and privileges of
Her Majesty's subjects.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, before we proceed any further, I think it requisite to
call your attention to two points. First, that your <i>Protestant</i>
ancestors, <i>really</i> did to our <i>Catholic</i> ancestors, what you now merely
<i>fancy</i>, without any grounds, that the <i>Catholics</i> of the present day,
are wishful to do <i>to you</i>. Now, upon this point, I shall thus argue:
Your Protestant ancestors did these things either <i>justly</i>, or <i>unjustly</i>
to our Catholic ancestors. If your Protestant ancestors did these
things <i>justly</i>, why should you Protestants make such a row, at the
<i>mere shadow</i> of these things being done again? But if your Protestant
ancestors, did these things <i>unjustly</i>, then you must acknowledge,
that the Church of England, owes its first foundation to acts
of injustice. The second point which I wish to settle, before I pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>ceed
any further, is that the spiritual members of the Church of
Rome, have the most just, and the only claim, to the honourable
name of Catholic. Let us now hasten to the first of these points.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, the following facts, as <i>historical</i> facts, are <i>undeniable</i>,
and whoever has the temerity to deny them as <i>historical</i> facts, I certainly
envy not his knowledge of, nor his veracity for, historical testimony.
<span class="smcap">Mark well</span>, I am not going to talk about the soundness, or
unsoundness of the following opinions, but I merely wish you to bear it
in mind, that it is an <i>indisputable historical</i> fact, that these opinions
were really, and conscientiously believed by the Christian world in
former ages. Well, then, the following are undeniable historical
facts: That, in former ages, the Christian world believed that the
Catholic Church, was the first Christian Church, and began with
our Saviour, that St. Peter was appointed, by divine authority, to
be the Head of this Church, that the Popes of Rome were the true
successors of St. Peter, by divine authority, and that they were
always considered, the one Shepherd, to whom all Christendom owed
spiritual obedience. All Christendom, in former ages, with here and
there an exception, held these opinions, and when the Christian
religion, was introduced into England (which was effectually done
about six hundred years after our Saviour), these opinions prevailed
in England, as well as in all other Christian countries. The Pope was
the Spiritual Head of the Church here, as well as in all the Christian
world. He exercised His Spiritual authority, without any co-partnership
with, or dependence upon the State. The Catholic Church
then also claimed to hold its possessions in the most independent
manner, it claimed a prescriptive right to all its possessions; in
short, it claimed to hold these possessions as firmly, and as justly,
as a man claims the rightful possession of his life, and his free will.
Now, mark well, I am not talking, as I just now observed, about
the soundness or unsoundness of these opinions, all that I am contending
for at present, is, that it is an indisputable historical fact,
that these opinions <i>then</i> prevailed in all Christian countries, and that
they prevailed in England, for at least nine hundred years, for England
was, at the very least, nine hundred years a Catholic nation.
During the prevalence of these opinions in England, arose churches,
parishes, cathedrals, and bishops' sees, monasteries, and many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
our universities, and colleges, <i>then</i> Catholic, but <i>now</i> Protestant.</p>

<p>Now, it is an historical fact recorded in the English Statute
Book, that your Protestant ancestors took from the Pope, his
spiritual power in England (for he never had any temporal power
here, as these pages will shortly prove to you), and your Protestant
ancestors took from the Catholics all the rich possessions
which belonged, in their estimation, by the strongest titles, to the
Catholic Church; and, <i>mind</i>, they did this after the Pope had
exercised his spiritual power in England, for at least nine hundred
years, and after the Catholics had held this church property for at
least nine hundred years. But, oh, you will reply, our Protestant
ancestors did this by Act of Parliament! I grant it, and surely you
will not think it unjust in me, to judge you now by your own
acknowledgments. Now, your Protestant ancestors did this <i>justly</i>,
or <i>unjustly</i>. If they did it <i>justly</i>, by act of Parliament, why cannot
the same thing be done again <i>justly</i>, by Act of Parliament?
Divide the population of England into two parts, and if you number
accurately, you will find, that the Catholics and the Dissenters form,
in my humble opinion, the greater half. Should, therefore, the
Catholics and Dissenters, obtain an Act of Parliament, to take this
church property from you Protestants, what reasonable arguments
could you advance against it? Turn the question up, or down, you
could not possibly escape. If you allege that you have had possession
for three hundred years, the Catholics and Dissenters will reply,
the Catholics had held it for at least nine hundred years. If you
argue it was given by Act of Parliament to your Protestant Church,
the Catholics and Dissenters will reply, the Catholics held it, by the
sanction of Government, for nine hundred years at least. In short,
turn the argument as you please, you are in a <i>regular fix</i>. Oh,
what a powerful, and unanswerable argument, have you forced me
to put into the mouths of the Dissenters, against <i>your</i> church property,
even if you got it justly! Allow me then to ask you, why all
this tirade and fury about the <i>mere fancy</i> of a thing being done to
you, which you assert, your ancestors did <i>justly</i> to the Catholics.
But if you took this property <i>unjustly</i> from the Catholics, then it is
as plain as the noon-day sun, that the Protestant Church, was first
founded upon acts of <i>injustice</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>But some will perhaps imagine, we really wish to take the church
property from the Protestants. In the Catholic times of England, the
church property was divided into three parts, one was for the support
of the clergy, another was for the repair of the churches, and the third
was for the support of the poor, and this third was always administered
to the poor with the most scrupulous exactness.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Hence, among
all the barefaced calumnies, which have been uttered against the
Catholics, even her bitterest enemies, could never say that she was
unjust to the poor. But the Protestant <i>reformed</i> Church thought
it would be the least trouble, to put these <i>three parts</i> into <i>one
whole</i> sum, and apply the <i>whole</i> of that sum to <i>themselves</i>, and then,
leave the nation to supply the other two parts, by <i>Church rates</i>, and
<i>Poor rates</i>. Now, let the Protestant Church, only give back to the
poor, that part which she unjustly took from them, and as for the
rest, I can only say, God speed them with it, and long may they
enjoy it.</p>

<p>Some of you gentlemen certainly appear, to be <i>worthy</i> descendents
of your Protestant ancestors, for <i>they</i> took from us our church possessions,
<i>you</i> are now enjoying these church possessions, but not
content with our possessions, you wish to deprive us, even of our <i>very
name</i>; for you are endeavouring, by every artifice, to deceive the
people, and make them believe&mdash;<i>you</i> and not <i>we</i> are the real Catholics.
You remind me of the words of the Poet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who steals my purse, steals trash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas mine, tis his, and has been slave to thousands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he who filches from me my good name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Robs me of that which not enriches him, but makes me poor indeed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You tell the people we Papists are Roman Catholics, but <i>you</i>
Protestants, are the <i>real</i> Catholics. Let us then, take up the Dictionary,
and <i>see</i> what is the real meaning of the word, <i>Catholic</i>.
According to the Dictionary, the word (Catholic) means universal.
Of course, then, when the word (Catholic) is applied to a Church, it
must mean the Universal Church. Let us then now see <i>which</i> is
the Universal Christian Church, and then we shall be able to judge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
who have the greatest right to the honourable name of Catholic. The
testimony which I shall cite to prove, that we are the most numerous
body of Christians, is that of Macaulay, a celebrated Protestant
historian of the present day, and whose historical pages have been
quoted against us, in many of the late public meetings, that have
been held. Of course, if his testimony is worthy of belief when
<i>against</i>, it must also be so when <i>for</i> us. Speaking of the great
body of the Roman Catholic Church, Macaulay says, "The numbers
of her communion are certainly not <i>fewer</i> than 150,000,000,
and it will be difficult to shew that all the other Christian sects
<i>united</i> amount to 120,000,000."<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> (Ed. Rev., Oct. 1840, p. 228.)
You here see, that Macaulay tells you, that the Roman Catholics
amount to <i>at least</i> 150,000,000, whilst all other Christian sects
<i>united</i> into one body, scarcely form 120,000,000. As therefore the
Roman Catholics form the greatest body of Christians, they must be
the Universal Church. But the Dictionary tells us, that the word
Catholic means Universal, therefore the Church of Rome is alone
both Universal and Catholic, and consequently has the most just and
only claim to the ancient and honourable name of Catholic.</p>

<p>I thought, gentlemen, before we proceeded to the main subjects in
discussion, we had better settle the two above points. For after you
had seen, that your Protestant ancestors had <i>really</i> and <i>actually</i>
done to the Catholics, what you <i>merely fancy</i> the Pope and the
Catholics are wishful at present to do to you, you would not think it
<i>unreasonable</i> in us, to claim your attention, whilst we shewed you
the unreasonable grounds of your <i>present</i> fears and alarms, and
that, after you had seen, that <i>we</i> have the <i>only</i> just claim to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
honourable name of Catholic,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> you would not be startled, at hearing
so often in these pages, that ancient name applied to the Spiritual
members of the Pope in these realms.</p>

<p>Let us now, gentlemen, proceed to the subject which has so lately
alarmed you, and many other Englishmen. There is nothing, that
shews a man to be so little, as to bluster, and talk about a subject,
which he does not understand. Now, gentlemen, had you been asked
at the meeting, what the Pope's Bull was? or, what the Catholic
Hierarchy meant? what a poser it would have been to the limbs of
the law, or even to the limbs of the Church, who attended your
meeting; for they either understood these subjects, or they did not.
If they really understood them, I am sure these pages will shew
every sensible person, they had no reason to consider the conduct of
the Pope, either "extraordinary or presumptuous," and if they did
not understand them, I really think it a very "extraordinary and
presumptuous movement" on their part, to talk against their fellow
Christians on subjects, of which they were ignorant. Had I done
so, would they not have been tempted to apply to me the words of
the Poet?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A shallow brain beyond a serious mask,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An Oracle within an empty cask."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For your information therefore, I will state in short, what we
Catholics mean by the Hierarchy, and the Pope's Bull. We all
know, that good <i>temporal</i> government, consists in having all the
various rights of its members, properly understood, and justly protected.
Thus the Queen, the Peers, the Commoners, the Magistrates,
in short, the higher classes, the middle classes, and the lower classes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
have all their rights properly defined, and their several interests
justly attended to in a good temporal government. Now reason
tells us, that this ought to be the case in a good <i>spiritual</i> government,
and we Catholics maintain, that these objects are best attained
by the means of a spiritual Hierarchy; and, at the same time we
believe, that this spiritual Hierarchy, can be established only by the
spiritual power of the Pope. When the Pope therefore thinks, that
either the number of his spiritual members, or their spiritual necessities,
require the establishment of the Hierarchy, in any part of the
world, he issues his spiritual Bull, or decrees to that effect; and all
the Archbishops, and Bishops, and Clergy, and laity, to whom this
spiritual government is extended, receive it as a spiritual boon, and
fully understand and believe, that it has regard <i>only</i> to <i>spiritual</i>
matters. They all know, and believe, that it has nothing to do with
any <i>temporal</i> matters whatever, in any shape or form, directly or
indirectly, and if any person, after this explanation, was so impudent
as to maintain, that the Hierarchy, or the Pope's Bull, had any
reference to any <i>temporal</i> matters, either directly, or indirectly,
affecting the <i>temporal</i> power of Her Majesty, over Her Catholic
subjects, and the <i>temporal</i> allegiance which they owe to Her Majesty,
my loyalty for our gracious Queen, and my feelings of honour, would
tempt me to address him in the words of the Poet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"A lie, an odious lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon my word, a lie, a wicked lie."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Gentlemen, after this short explanation of the Hierarchy, and of
the Pope's Bull, I appeal to you as free-born Englishmen, whether
there can be any English law, or statute against it? If there be,
where is our vaunted boast, of "liberty of conscience <i>to all</i>?" Now
<span class="small">MARK</span>, whether there be any law in the Statute Book against it, I do
not pretend to have sufficient of the lawyer in me to determine, but
<i>this</i>, I will shew you, that the acts of the Pope, in establishing the
spiritual Hierarchy in this kingdom, by his Bull, or spiritual decrees,
are in keeping with the spirit, upon which the English law has
acted during these late years.</p>

<p>By the spirit of the English law, we, Catholics, are allowed to
maintain the Pope's supremacy in ecclesiastical, and religious matters;
we are also allowed to be governed by Catholic Bishops, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of course, we are allowed to be governed by them, according to the
proper and perfect form of Episcopal government, and there is no
English law, to prevent these Catholic Bishops from taking the titles
of any place, provided they are not titles of places, held by the Anglican
Hierarchy. Now, these conditions have been observed, in the
late establishment of the Catholic Hierarchy in these realms.</p>

<p>And that it is in keeping with the spirit of the English Law,
Lord John Russell's own words, will convince you. In the House
of Commons, August 6th, 1846, he said, "There is another offence
of introducing a Bull of the Pope into the country, the question is,
whether it is desirable to keep up that, or any other penalty, for
such an offence. It does appear to me, that we cannot possibly
attempt, to prevent the introduction of the Pope's Bulls into this
country. There are certain Bulls of the Pope, which are <i>absolutely
necessary</i>, for the appointment of Bishops and Pastors, belonging to
the Roman Catholic Church. It would be quite <i>impossible</i>, to prevent
the introduction of such Bulls." (Hansard, vol. lxxxviii.,
p. 362.) Again, what said Lord Lyndhurst, speaking, in the
House of Lords. "You tolerate the Catholic Prelates, and you
know, that these Prelates cannot carry on, their Church Establishment,
without holding communication with the Pope of Rome. If
the laws allow the doctrine, and discipline of the Roman Catholic
Church, it (the Roman Catholic Church) ought to be permitted, to
be carried on <i>perfectly</i> and <i>properly</i>." (Hansard, vol. lxxxv., p.
1261.) So you see, that this Noble Lord proclaims, that to pretend
to <i>tolerate</i> the Catholic Religion as we do; and <i>yet</i>, <i>prevent</i> the
Catholics from holding <i>free</i> communication with the Pope, would be
a mere nullity. The Catholics, says he, should be allowed to carry
out the organization of their Church <i>perfectly</i> and <i>properly</i>. Now,
<i>this</i> cannot be done without the <i>Hierarchy</i>. Accordingly, all the
penal laws in question were, then and there, torn from the statute
book.</p>

<p>Also Joseph Hume, Esq., who may be justly styled, the father of
the present House of Commons, and who, in that House, has been so
long the promoter, the pillar, and the bulwark of civil and religious
liberty, honourably, and openly, tells the world, that the Pope is warranted,
in all he has done, by the proceedings of Sir Robert Peel's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
government. These are the words of the noble champion of civil and
religious liberty&mdash;"Your view of the subject, will be adopted as soon
as the thinking part of the public, get their eyes opened to the real
merits of the alleged innovation. I say alleged, because Mr. C. C.
Grenville has shewn, that the Pope is warranted in all he has done, by
the proceedings of Sir Robert Peel's government, which were not at
the time objected to by any person, except by Sir Robert Inglis, and
his limited class."&mdash;(Joseph Hume, to the Editor of the <i>Hull Advertiser</i>,
Nov. 18th, 1850.)</p>

<p>There was a time, when the Protestant Bishops were excluded,
for some time, from the House of Lords. In 1661, a motion was
made to restore these Protestant Prelates to their seats, and <i>mind</i>,
six and twenty Catholic Peers voted in favour of these Protestant
Bishops. But such is the illiberality of the present time, that now,
the Catholics find the most determined and eager opposition on the
Bishop's bench. There are, however, exceptions; few, indeed, but
on that account, more entitled to our gratitude. Long will the
name of the late Bishop of Norwich, be cherished in the remembrance
of every sincere Catholic. And happy am I to observe,
another Protestant Prelate, willing to walk in his charitable footsteps.
I mean the sensible, the pious, and the learned present
Protestant Bishop of St. Davids. This illustrious Protestant
Prelate, liberally and candidly, told the Archbishop of Canterbury,
that in his humble opinion, "the provision cited from the Act of
Elizabeth, has been virtually repealed by the Roman Catholic Relief
Act *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* And it was equally set 'at defiance,' by the
appointment of Vicars Apostolic, who have so long exercised their
functions without complaint or molestation. And it seems unreasonable,
to charge the Pope with defying a law which, has been so long
permitted to sleep." For these and other reasons, this most liberal
minded Protestant Prelate, lately refused to sign the address of the
other Protestant Bishops to the Queen. (Bishop of St. Davids to the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Nov. 26th, 1850.) Well I cannot but
gratefully, address this generous Prelate in the words of the poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&mdash;&mdash;"I quit you now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But peradventure I may come again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your bounteous kindness ne'er shall be forgot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While beats this warm heart within my bosom."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Certainly, you will say, these are high, and weighty authorities on
the Catholic side, and clearly demonstrate, that there can be nothing
wrong, on the Pope's sending his <i>Bulls</i>, into <i>this</i> country. But,
perhaps, the <i>greatest</i> grievance lies in <i>this</i>, that the <i>Catholic</i>
Bishops, have assumed <i>English</i> titles, calling themselves Bishops
of Hexham, of Beverley, &amp;c. <i>This</i>, you hear it said, is <i>contrary
to all</i> law and decency. Now, <i>mark</i>, gentlemen, how soon I shall
prove to you, that it is neither against law, nor decency. I observe
that the law as it regards Catholics, <i>forbids only one</i> thing, it
forbids <i>Catholic</i> Bishops, to assume the titles of <i>Protestant</i> sees.
Thus it forbids us, to have an Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i>, or a
Bishop of <i>London</i>, of <i>Durham</i>, &amp;c. And why so? Because there
are <i>Protestant</i> Bishops of <i>these</i> places. But it <i>manifestly</i> allows us
to take the titles of <i>those</i> places, in which, there are no Protestant
Bishops. For, if the law meant, to exclude us from <i>all</i> places and
<i>all</i> titles <i>whatsoever</i>, why did it <i>not say so</i>? But, it says <i>no such</i>
thing. It excludes us <i>only</i> from places where there are <i>Protestant</i>
Bishops. Well, this restrictive law, the <i>only</i> law, that there is
upon the question, has been most <i>scrupulously</i> observed in <i>every</i>
instance by the Catholics. Not <i>one</i> of their Bishops, has assumed
the title of any <i>Protestant</i> see. For who ever heard of a <i>Protestant</i>
Bishop of Hexham, of Beverley, or of Liverpool. How then can it
be contrary to law? But I have yet, more to say on this subject.
Lord John Russell is an advocate for the repeal of <i>even</i> this <i>restrictive</i>
law, which he considers, an absurdity in a land of religious
liberty. Nay, he considers it <i>childish</i> to hold the Catholics under
such restrictions. "I believe," said he (in July 19th, 1845, speaking
in the House of Commons,) "I believe we may repeal, those
insulting clauses, which prevent a Roman Catholic assuming a title
held, by a Bishop of the Established Church. I can conceive <i>no
good</i> grounds, for the continuance of this restriction." (Hansard,
vol. lxxxii., p. 290.) And again on February 5, 1846, "as to preventing
persons assuming <i>particular</i> titles, nothing can be more
<i>absurd</i> and <i>puerile</i>, than to keep up <i>such</i> a distinction." (Hansard,
vol. lxxxiii., p. 502.) Now, gentlemen, <i>this</i> was spoken in the
<i>House of Commons</i>, and by the <i>first</i> Minister of the Crown. You
see, <i>he</i> vindicates for the Catholics, <i>greater</i> liberty than <i>they</i> have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
either <i>exercised</i>, or <i>demanded</i>; the liberty to have Catholic
Bishops, <i>side</i> by <i>side</i>, with the <i>Protestant</i> Bishops <i>throughout</i> the
land. And yet, let me ask, did the then Member for <i>Whitby</i>, or
indeed <i>any</i>, of the thirty and more members, who represent this
great county of York, raise a <i>voice</i> against <i>these</i> opinions and
views? Did they cry out, that <i>this</i>, would be <i>an innovation</i> of
the <i>Royal</i> prerogative, and an <i>encroachment</i> upon the <i>spiritual</i>,
or <i>civil</i> liberties of this realm. No, <i>not they</i>, not <i>one</i> of them.
Both the <i>Parliament</i> and the <i>Public</i> heard <i>all</i> this, either with
<i>approbation</i>, or with <i>indifference</i>. Judge, then, with what scorn
the Catholics, hear themselves charged with insidiousness, and
aggression. Insidiousness! Why, the leaders of the two great
portions, in the state (for who stood <i>higher</i> with the <i>Tories</i> than
<i>Lord Lyndhurst</i>, and among the <i>Whigs</i>, than <i>Lord John Russell</i>),
and yet, these <i>two</i> leaders, <i>actually</i> encouraged, and invited the
Catholics <i>to do</i>, what they <i>have</i> done. I repeat, they not only
claimed for the Catholics the <i>right to do</i> them, but <i>encouraged</i>
them <i>to do</i> them. After the Catholics had <i>thus</i> been encouraged,
and backed by two of the first leaders, <i>one</i> of the Whigs, and <i>one</i>
of the <i>Tories</i>, after they had received the sanction of the <i>public</i> by
its silence, or indifference on these points, the Catholics at last
received the Hierarchy from the Pope's hands; when lo! Lord
John Russell, immediately writes a flaming philippic on the subject,
suddenly and unjustly rouses the indignation of the people; and the
Protestant clergy immediately head the crusade against the Catholics,
for <i>doing</i>, what they had been encouraged, and invited <i>to do</i> by
two of the first ministers of the land, and <i>for doing</i>, what the
English <i>public</i> had <i>already</i> sanctioned, by its silence, or by its
indifference. Really, gentlemen, was not this a "most extraordinary
and presumptuous movement" on the <i>rights</i> of your Catholic fellow
subjects? And, <i>this</i>, in the <i>nineteenth</i> century, when the march of
intellect, and of civil, and religious liberty, have been making such
rapid progress in the British Empire. But what have I to say to
Lord John Russell's late letter? I answer, it is not <i>my</i> business to
reconcile Lord John Russell's <i>former</i> declarations, with <i>his present
late</i> proceedings, they are as <i>marvellous</i> and <i>unaccountable</i> in the
<i>eyes</i> of the <i>public</i>, as they are in <i>mine</i>. He will shortly have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
give an account of his stewardship, before the Parliament, in whose
<i>presence</i>, he made the <i>declarations</i>, which I have <i>quoted</i>. If he
<i>means</i> to continue a <i>Champion</i> of <i>civil</i> and <i>religious</i> liberty, he
must <i>retrace</i> his steps&mdash;but if he chooses to <i>abandon</i> the <i>sacred</i>
cause, <i>then</i>, he will dwindle into a <i>most insignificant</i>, and <i>contemptible</i>
statesman: and will not be <i>permitted long to direct</i> the
government of a <i>free</i> and <i>liberal</i> people.</p>

<p>Thus you see, gentlemen, that the words of Lord John Russell,
and of Lord Lyndhurst, the opinion of Joseph Hume, Esq., and
that of the learned Protestant Bishop of St. Davids, plainly shew,
that the late acts of the Pope, have been in keeping, with the
present spirit of the English law.</p>

<p>Hence in Ireland, the Catholic Hierarchy, has not only been
recognised, but royally honoured; and the same form of Ecclesiastical
Government, has been gradually extended, to the greater part
of our Colonies. Australia was the first, which obtained this spiritual
advantage, and this was <i>openly</i> done, and was <i>publicly</i> known, and
yet, no remonstrance was ever made against it. The Catholic Prelates
of Australia, in every document, are addressed by their titles,
and are acknowledged, and salaried, as Archbishops and Bishops,
respectively, and this not by one, but by successive English governments.
Our North American possessions, were the next, to receive
this spiritual government, Kingston, Byetown, Toronto, and Halifax,
have been erected into dioceses by the Holy See, and the titles of
their respective Bishops, are acknowledged by their local governments.
The Holy See, has also formed a new ecclesiastical province
in the West Indies, where several Vicars Apostolic, have been
appointed with titles, and with all the spiritual powers, allowed by
the Hierarchy. Now, gentlemen, if the Catholics of <i>Ireland</i>, and
the Catholics of our <i>English</i> Colonies, are thus allowed by Government,
to enjoy the spiritual benefits of the Hierarchy, do you not
think it unreasonable, that the Catholics <i>of England</i>, should be
refused the same spiritual blessings? Do not the Dissenters also,
enjoy in England, the free exercise of <i>their</i> spiritual powers? Dr.
Dillon, assumed the power, and ordained, what he called Presbyters,
and no Englishman thought proper, to call him to account, for
assuming those spiritual powers. The Moravians, and the Irvinites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
or the Apostolicals, have their Bishops in England, and yet, they
are not taxed with illegality. The Scotch Kirk, the Baptists, the
Methodists, the Quakers, the Independents, the Presbyterians, and
all other Dissenters, appoint their Ministers for themselves, and mark
the limits of the separate districts, in which they are to exercise their
spiritual authority, and yet, no one has the presumption, to question
the legality of their exercising such authority in England. If therefore,
all these various dissenting sects are allowed these spiritual
privileges, why should the English free-born Catholics, be debarred
from them?</p>

<p>Her present Majesty was advised to erect, and did erect, (5 Vic.
cap. 6.) a Bishopric of Jerusalem, and assigned to it a diocese,
in which the three great Patriarchates of Antioch, Jerusalem, and
Alexandria, were formed into one See, which had episcopal jurisdiction
over Syria, Chaldea, Egypt, and Abyssinia, and subject to
further limitations, or alterations at the Royal Will. Now do any
of these possessions belong to Her Majesty? No. But you may
reply, there are in some, and may be in others, British Protestants,
and therefore, the Queen thought proper, to extend Her spiritual
blessings to them. Granted. Why therefore, has not the Pope, an
equal right to extend <i>his</i> spiritual blessings to the Catholics of
England? It is plain then, that the Irish Catholics, and the
Catholics of many of our Colonies, are allowed to exercise <i>their</i>
spiritual rights unmolested, it is plain that all other dissenting sects,
are allowed to enjoy in England the same spiritual privileges, and it
is plain likewise, that the Queen assumes and exercises abroad, in
the most independent manner, Her spiritual powers, tell me then, in
the name of common sense, by what law, either human, or divine,
you wish to deprive the English Catholics of the free exercise of
<i>their</i> spiritual rights?</p>

<p>Oh, but you will object, "the Pope has assumed a right over us
Protestants, he has parcelled out the land of England, he has named
Archbishops and Bishops, and appointed them to rule over <i>us</i>, whom
he impudently styles heretics." To this objection, gentlemen, I
reply, Do the Catholics in England acknowledge the Queen's
supremacy in <i>spiritual</i> matters? Do the Dissenters of England
acknowledge Her supremacy in <i>spiritual</i> matters? No. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
divide the English population into two parts, and if you calculate
accurately, you will find, that the greater half of the English population,
consists of Catholics and Dissenters, who do not acknowledge
the Queen's <i>spiritual</i> supremacy. But when the Queen issues Her
Spiritual Instruments, or if you please, Bulls, does she not parcel
out the land of England? Does she not name Archbishops, and
Bishops, and <i>apparently</i> appoint them to rule over <i>us Catholics</i> and
<i>Dissenters</i>, in short, does <i>She</i> not in those Spiritual Instruments, or
Bulls, <i>apparently</i> assume over <i>us</i> Catholics and Dissenters, the very
same spiritual power, which the Pope appears to assume, in His
Bulls, over Protestant Englishmen? But do you ever hear of us
Catholics, or Dissenters, styling this an extraordinary movement on
the part of the Queen? No. Because we have the common sense
to know, that such parcelling out of the land, and such extension of
Her <i>Spiritual</i> Authority to her Archbishops, and Bishops, regard
only the <i>real</i> Protestants of the land, and that they have no more to
do with us and the Dissenters, in a <i>spiritual</i> point of view, than
they have with the inhabitants of Turkey.</p>

<p>If you would likewise ask some of the limbs of the law, who
attended your meeting, they would inform you, that in Acts of Parliament,
that in deeds, and in the drawing up almost all the various
instruments of the law, there are certain forms, which to <i>us</i> appear
most ridiculous, and outrageous, and if you questioned them on these
points, and asked them, about all this strange rigmarole of words
and of phraseology, they would tell you, it is only a certain necessary
form in law, and that although it may appear strange <i>to other</i>
people, still, it is perfectly understood <i>by all</i>, who are versed in the
laws of the land.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> Why cannot these gentlemen, therefore, have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
good sense to extend this explanation to the Pope's Bull, and then
they would find this parcelling out the land by the Pope's Bull, and
this delegation of spiritual power, of Archbishops, and Bishops, as if
extending to Protestants, was a mere phantom of their own imagination,
and that in reality, it regarded <i>none</i>, but the <i>spiritual</i> subjects
of the <i>Pope</i> in this kingdom, and that it did not regard <i>even them</i>,
only in a <i>spiritual</i>, and <i>not</i> in a <i>temporal</i> point of view, either
directly or indirectly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p>I observe, in your public notice for your meeting, two Dissenting
Ministers, put their names to the requisition. Now, although the
Protestant Church may <i>honour</i> these gentlemen, with the name of
<i>Reverend</i>, does it consider them to be ministers? It certainly does
not.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> And I will prove it to you. If these Ministers were to go
over to the <i>Protestant</i> Church, it would ordain them, and by that
act, tell them that <i>before</i>, they were mere <i>phantoms</i> of Ministers,
and that they had <i>never</i> had any spiritual power, or jurisdiction
whatever. If therefore the orthodox Protestant gentleman, whose
name stands so conspicuously between these two Dissenting Reverends,
were to be asked, why he styled them Reverends, when his
own Church, considers them as mere phantoms of Ministers, what
would he say? Of course he would tell us, it was a mere matter of
courtesy, for he was obliged to agree with his Church, that they
were mere phantoms of Ministers. Now, gentlemen, just apply this
to the Pope's Bull in <i>your</i> regard. You read the Pope's Bull, and
erroneously imagine that the spiritual powers, which it asserts,
really regards (or is to regard) you Protestants. Whereas you
ought to consider it, as a <i>mere phantom</i> of <i>spiritual</i> power in <i>your</i>
regard, and I moreover add, you ought to consider it, as a mere
phantom in any <i>temporal</i> point of view, even as it regards <i>the
Catholics</i>. Do this, gentlemen, and then, you will perceive, that
the idea of it extending to <i>you</i> Protestants, either in any <i>spiritual</i>,
or <i>temporal</i> point of view, whatever, is a mere chimera of your own
imaginations.</p>

<p>But after all, I know many of you will <i>still</i> urge, that the Pope
may <i>gradually</i> extend his <i>spiritual</i> power over you, and then, by
degrees extend his <i>temporal</i> power over you, until at last, he has
completely established over you his spiritual and temporal domination.
Gentlemen, I will answer this argument shortly indeed, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
hope satisfactorily, and I feel confident that, unless you are as the
poet says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Convince a man against his will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'll hold the same opinion still,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>you will be convinced, from what I shall advance, that the above
objection, is another chimera of your own imaginations.</p>

<p>True and genuine religion, must be founded on the free, and
spontaneous consent of the heart. If therefore, you Protestants
ever allow the Pope, to extend his spiritual power over you, <i>without</i>
having <i>first</i> sincerely, and deliberately considered the <i>real</i> grounds
of the Catholic Faith, and of the Pope's title to spiritual supremacy,
and without your having <i>first</i> given your <i>free</i>, and <i>spontaneous</i>
consent to them, I hope you will forgive me, if I politely tell you, I
should consider you as a set of religious donkeys, and that you
ought not to be allowed to <i>bray</i> in this free country.</p>

<p>But you will object, it will be <i>you</i> Catholics headed by the Pope,
that will make us renounce the <i>Protestant</i>, and embrace the <i>Catholic</i>
faith. To this objection I answer. First, the Catholics of England
have promised to maintain, support, and defend, to the utmost of
their power, the succession to the crown. Now, this succession, by
an act entitled, "an act for the further limitation of the crown", is,
and stands limited to the Princess Sophia, Electress, Duchess Dowager
of Hanover, and to the heirs of her Body, <i>being Protestants</i>.
Such are the very terms of the oath, which we Catholics have
taken; as long therefore, as the Established Church is secure of
having a Protestant Sovereign, it cannot be in any danger of
subversion.</p>

<p>Secondly. The Irish Catholics have gone still further, and to
silence even the predictions of their enemies, have disclaimed, disavowed,
and solemnly abjured every intention, to subvert the
present Church Establishment, for the purpose of substituting a
Catholic Establishment in its stead, and have solemnly sworn, that
they will not exercise any privilege, to which they are, or may
be entitled, to disturb, or weaken the Protestant religion in that
kingdom.</p>

<p>Thirdly. But I will suppose for a moment, that the Catholics
were at last to determine to perjure themselves, and to violate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
promises, to which they are so solemnly pledged, let us see the
obstacles, they would have to surmount. First, there would be
the Sovereign, the head of the Protestant Church, with the immense
patronage of the Crown at her (or his) disposal; secondly, there
would be all the spiritual Peers, and with the exception of a
few Catholics, all the temporal Peers; thirdly, there would be
the great majority in the House of Commons, in proportion to
at least, ten Protestants to one Catholic. Now, by what spirit
of magic, are a <i>few</i> Catholic Peers, to become the <i>majority</i> of the
House of Lords, or is <i>one</i> Catholic Commoner, to outvote <i>ten</i> Protestants.
By what miracle, is the Queen (or King) to abandon the
defence of <i>that</i> Church, of which she (or he) is by conviction a
member, and by law, supreme head? By what man&oelig;uvres, are the
Catholics so to blind the confidence of the Sovereign, as to worm
themselves into the possession of all places, of power, and trust?
Before the Catholics can aid the Pope to extend his temporal or
spiritual power over you Protestants, they will have to surmount all
the above obstacles. But by what human power can they ever surmount
the above obstacles? Really, gentlemen, is it not childish to
talk either about Catholics forcing you to become Catholics, or their
wishing to aid the Pope, to extend his spiritual or temporal domination
over you Protestants, with all the above obstacles staring you in
the face.</p>

<p>But, gentlemen, if on the other hand, you should think proper to
seriously, and conscientiously, examine the <i>real</i> grounds of the
Catholic religion, and if you should think proper, to examine <i>seriously</i>,
and <i>conscientiously</i>, whether the Pope, is the <i>real</i> successor
of Saint Peter, and of course in that case, the <i>real</i> spiritual head of
Christ's Church, if you should ask yourselves the reason, why the
Catholic Faith, has been the belief of the most extensive, and
enlightened nations of Europe, and of the most illustrious characters,
that ever did honour to the name of man,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> if upon careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
investigation, you should find that the Catholic Faith, was the faith
of those, who built our Cathedrals, who erected our Universities,
who laid the foundation of our envied Constitution, and who secured
the great charter of our rights at Runnymede, in short, if you
should find that the members of this creed, have in every age, stood
forth the champions of liberty, and at the same time remained
faithful worshippers of God, if after the most careful, and impartial
investigation, you should find all these things to be real, and undeniable
facts, <i>then</i> I would address you in the words, with which St.
Paul addressed King Agrippa, "I would to God, that both in little,
and in much, not only thou, but also, all that hear me this day,
should become such as I also am, except these bonds." (Acts, ch.
xxvi., v. 28.) Yes, gentlemen, I repeat it, if after the most serious,
and minute investigation, you should find the above things <i>real</i>, and
<i>undeniable</i> facts, <i>then</i>, gentlemen, the sincere wish of my heart
would be, that you might all become Catholics, and the <i>spiritual</i>
children of the head of our Church, but, <i>mind</i>, without our bonds,
that is, without having to suffer, what our Catholic ancestors had
to suffer for their faith,<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> a faith, which they conscientiously held
as their best inheritance, and which, they held more dear, than
life itself.</p>

<p>I would also address you in the words, in which Gamaliel, a
doctor of the law, addressed the Jewish Council respecting the
Apostles, who were unjustly cast into prison. "And now, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>fore,
I say to you, refrain from these men, and let them alone: for
if this counsel, or this work, be of men, it will come to nought; but
if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it, lest perhaps, even you be
found to fight against God." (Acts, ch. 5, v. 38, 39.) Gentlemen,
if the Catholic Faith, be an invention of <i>human</i> counsel, and a work
of <i>human</i> policy, rest assured, it will of <i>itself</i> crumble into nought,
but if it be <i>of God</i>, and if it be the <i>will of God</i>, that England
should return to her ancient faith, you cannot overthrow it, and you
cannot fight against God, for as the wise man says, "there is
no wisdom, there is no prudence, there is no counsel against the
Lord." (Prov. ch. xxi., v. 30.)</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I think you must acknowledge, that I have answered,
shortly indeed, but I hope satisfactorily, your objection, as to the
Pope's gradually extending his <i>spiritual</i>, and temporal domination
over you Protestants. Gentlemen, I am not aware, that any one
at your meeting, was so uncourteous as to throw in the face of
Catholics, either the Gunpowder, or Oates' plots. Still, you are
aware, that it has been done at <i>many</i> of the late meetings, and
in many places of England, to the injustice of Catholics. Allow
me, to solicit your attention, whilst I say a few words respecting
each of these plots, and whilst I show you, it is most unjust to
throw those diabolical plots in the face of Catholics, either of
the present, or of former ages.</p>

<p>The Guy Fawkes plot, or as it is usually termed, the Gunpowder
Plot, is often sneeringly, and insultingly thrown in the face of
Catholics. Now let it be remembered, that the original conspirators
were only eight in number, that they were also of the most abandoned
character, and that some of them, years before, had abjured
the Catholic faith, and let it also be remembered, that this plot was
disclosed even by a Catholic, Lord Monteagle, and that the Pope in
a letter expressed his detestation of it, and ordered the Catholic
clergy, to prevent by all means in their power, all similar conspiracies,
and to exhort the people to patience and obedience. Now
I ask, is it reasonable, that the wicked deeds of these few and
abandoned conspirators, should be thrown in the face of the whole
body of Catholics; as well might you upbraid our Saviour with the
crimes of Judas. The plot was unknown to all good Catholics, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
had nothing whatever to do with it, and it, and all other plotting
whatever, were condemned and forbidden in the most severe manner,
by the Clergy and the Pope. What could Catholics do more?
Why, therefore, are the Catholics of the present times to be condemned
for a plot with which they had no more to do, than the
Protestants of the present day? But I will suppose for a moment,
this diabolical plot was concocted by real Catholics. Can it be
unreasonably urged, against the Catholics of the present day? If
you answer, yes, I will then prove that the Ministers who attended
your meeting, were cursers, murderers, and deserters of Christ.
For if you ask each of them, if he is a minister of Christ, he will
answer, certainly. Well, then, one of the Apostles betrayed our
Saviour, another by oaths and curses, denied him, and all deserted
him on the night of his passion. Now, if the above line of argumentation,
against Catholics be valid, then I may conclude, that the
Ministers who attended your meeting, were murderers, cursers,
deniers, and deserters of Christ. Really, if I were to adopt this
mode of argumentation against them, you would think, and justly,
the <i>upper stories</i> of my intellect were of a very strange structure.
How can persons, therefore, have the barefacedness to apply such
reasoning to the Catholics of the present day, respecting the Gunpowder
Plot.</p>

<p>Whoever will read the history of Titus Oates's Plot, will find
that it was concocted against the Catholics, by some of the brightest
characters for rascality, and perjury, and infamy, and cruelty, that
the world ever beheld. Oates' plot consisted in this, that he accused
the Catholics, and Jesuits in particular, of a plot, to murder King
Charles the II., (1678), to transfer the sovereignty of the realm to
the Pope, and to extirpate the Protestant religion from the land.
But was not Titus Oates himself a <i>Jesuit</i>, or at least, a <i>Catholic</i>?
You shall hear who Titus Oates was, from the <i>pen</i> of <i>Protestant</i>
Historians.</p>

<p>"Oates, the former of this dreadful plot, was himself the most
infamous of mankind. He was the son of an Anabaptist preacher,
took orders in the Church of England, became chaplain on board
the fleet, and was dismissed for some unnatural practices, not fit to
be named." (See Hume's History.) You shall hear too, who his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
accomplices were; "Bedloe, a man, if <i>possible</i>, more infamous
than Oates himself;" (See Hume's History.) And these were
soon backed by others. "A wretch, named Carstairs led the way,
and soon, from all the brothels, gambling houses, and spunging
houses of London, <i>false witnesses</i> poured in, to swear away the lives
of Roman Catholics." (See Macaulay's History of England.) And
yet, on the barefaced testimony, of these abandoned, and infamous
wretches, the Catholic Noblemen and Gentlemen, were, with the
exception of the Duke of York, expelled from their seats in Parliament.
Some of them, (although as innocent of the crimes of
which they were accused, as the new-born babe), were tried, and
executed on the false, and contradictory evidence, of these base
wretches. All of them, died protesting their innocence; and many
of them, embraced the opportunity to declare their abhorrence, of
the doctrines so commonly, but so unjustly, attributed to Catholics.
Their speeches at the place of execution, are still on record. (See
"A Remonstrance of Piety and Innocence," 1683. Dodd's History,
vol. iii., p. 356.) And if ever a man, may be believed to speak with
sincerity, it is when, in the full possession of his senses, he stands
on the brink of eternity, and expects the next moment, to be presented
before an Omniscient Judge. One of them, Lord Stafford,
referred the Peers, at his trial, for an account of his religious creed,
to a small tract, entitled "Catholic Principles." This small tract
has often been printed, and was then, and is still, considered to
convey an accurate notion of the Catholic faith. Well may Hume
say, that "this Popish plot, is an incident, which, for the credit of
the nation, it were better to bury in eternal oblivion, but which it is
necessary to perpetuate, both for the truth of history, and to warn,
if possible, their posterity, and all mankind, never again to fall into
so <i>shameful</i>, so <i>barbarous</i> a <i>delusion</i>." (See Hume's History.)
And yet Oates was rewarded with appointments in the Royal
Palace, and had 1200 a year assigned him, as the wages of
his iniquity, and Bedloe 500: and Oates was called "the Saviour
of the nation."</p>

<p>But how did these wretches come off at last? You shall hear
again, from Mr. Macaulay. About seven years later, when the
madness, and the delusion of the people, had passed away, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
resolved, to bring these wretches, who had spilled so much blood, to
their <i>own</i> trial. "Some of the wretches," (says Macaulay) "were
already beyond the reach of justice. Bedloe had died in his wickedness,
without one sign of remorse or shame. Dugdale had followed
him to the grave, driven mad by the furies of an evil conscience,
and with loud shrieks, imploring those, who stood around his bed, to
take away Lord Stafford. (A Catholic Lord, whose life he had
sworn away, seven years ago.) Carstairs, too, was gone. His end,
was all horror, and despair, and with his last breath, he told his
attendants to throw him into a ditch, like a dog, for that he was
not fit, to sleep in Christian burial ground." Mr. Macaulay thus
describes Oates' appearance, at <i>his</i> trial. "A few years earlier,
his short neck, his legs uneven, as those of a badger, his forehead
low, as that of a baboon, his purple cheeks, and monstrous length of
chin, had been familiar to all, who frequented the courts of law.
He had been the idol of the nation&mdash;men had uncovered their heads
to him, and called him, the deliverer of his country. They <i>now
shuddered</i> at the sight of the <i>hideous</i> features, on which <i>villany</i>
seemed to be written, by the <i>hand of God</i>." (See Macaulay's
History of England.) Horrible as were the sufferings of Oates,
they did not equal his crimes. Such, gentlemen, is a short, but
true account of Titus Oates's Plot, and of his abandoned, and
perjured accomplices. And yet, some have the audacity to throw
this infamous plot, in the face of the Catholics, even at the present
day. To such I would say, "you are either ignorant of history, or
not; if you are ignorant of history, it is the part of a simpleton, to
talk on subjects which he does not understand." But if you are
acquainted with history, I beg to address you in the words of
the poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A moral, sensible, and well bred man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will not offend me, and no other can."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Gentlemen, I now appeal to you, if it is not evident from what I
have advanced in the preceding pages, that the late crusade against
Catholics, has been most unjust, and most cruel. If you will
seriously, and coolly, and impartially consider what has been ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>vanced,
you must be convinced, that all your alarms, and those
of many other Englishmen, are mere chimeras of your own imaginations.
But if, to some of you, the above reasoning does not appear
satisfactory, I am sure it will to every sensible and unbiased
Englishman. Englishmen, indeed, like all other nations, have <i>their
faults</i>, and <i>their perfections</i>. In times of general excitement, and
of public panic, nothing is too absurd, for their credulity. In the
hour of excitement, and of public panic, <i>pigmies</i>, appear <i>giants</i> to
them, and <i>mole-hills</i>, swell into <i>mountains</i>. Witness the late railway
mania. This mania, spread like wildfire, through the higher,
the middle, and even the lower classes, and threw the whole nation,
into a fever of excitement. Before their excited imaginations, rose
the golden dreams of their <i>six</i>, and <i>eight</i>, and <i>ten</i> per cent., of railways,
as the <i>best</i> and <i>surest</i> investment for their property, in short,
as the easiest and most direct means, of turning their mole-hills of
money into mountains of gold. <i>In vain</i>, were Englishmen warned,
and cautioned by <i>sensible</i>, and <i>thinking</i> persons, <i>against</i> these
<i>golden</i> prospects of their excited imaginations. Convinced, they
either <i>would not</i>, or <i>could not</i> be. But lo! the mighty bubble
burst, and then, to their loss, and sorrow, they both <i>saw</i>, and
<i>acknowledged</i> the <i>folly</i> of their former excitement, of their <i>railway
golden dreams</i>.</p>

<p>Again, I say, when Englishmen return to their <i>cooler</i> moments,
and <i>seriously</i> reflect, on all the <i>late hubbub</i>, about <i>Pope's Bulls</i>,
and <i>Guy Fawkes</i>, and <i>Gunpowder Plots</i>, and <i>Catholic Mummeries
and Superstitions</i>, I feel confident, they will verify the words of
Dr. Hughes, the Catholic Prelate of New York, who lately preached
in London, on his way to Rome. "I am sure (says this distinguished
Prelate,) that this great, and liberal nation, (England)
<i>will</i>, after this <i>temporary</i> excitement is <i>over</i>, <i>be ashamed</i> of their
<i>present</i> conduct, and will be <i>astonished</i>, how they could <i>ever think</i>,
of proposing any steps, which tended to <i>abridge</i>, the <i>liberty</i> of <i>any</i>
portion, of their countrymen, and violate that freedom in religion,
which <i>is their boast</i>. The (English) Ministry <i>cannot</i> go <i>one</i> step
back, upon the track of <i>persecutions</i>, if they make but <i>one</i> step,
in <i>that</i> direction, they will be <i>condemned</i>, by <i>every liberal</i> minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
man, and will be looked upon, with <i>contempt</i> by the <i>rest</i> of the
nations of the <i>world</i>." (Dr. Hughes' Sermon. London, December
1st, 1850.)</p>

<p>Hence we find, that <i>most</i>, of the <i>great</i> and <i>enlightened</i> statesmen
of <i>England</i>, always <i>boldly</i>, and <i>freely</i>, advocated the freedom, and
liberties of the <i>Catholics</i>. <i>As long</i>, as we retain <i>any</i> respect for
genius, and discernment, for Parliamentary eloquence, and political
wisdom, the names of Pitt, and of Fox, of Burke, and of Windham,
of Canning, and of Peel, will stand <i>foremost</i>, in the <i>public</i> estimation.
These eminent statesmen, however they might <i>differ</i> on
<i>other</i> subjects, concurred in supporting the <i>cause</i> of the <i>Catholics</i>.
<i>Their's</i> was the conviction of <i>liberal</i>, and <i>enlightened</i> minds, who
forgot the distinctions of <i>party</i>, in their <i>zeal</i>, to serve the cause of
<i>justice</i>, and of <i>freedom</i>. Yes, they <i>well knew</i>, that the <i>British</i>
Constitution, was <i>not</i> a constitution of <i>restraints</i>, and <i>penalties</i>,
that it was <i>framed</i> to preserve the rights of <i>freemen</i>, that it
was formed, for the <i>whole</i>, not for a <i>part</i>, and that it was destined,
like the sun, to shed its benign influence <i>upon all</i>. And <i>hence</i>,
they knew, that they could not <i>better</i> consult its <i>prosperity</i> and
<i>stability</i>, than by fearlessly, and manfully battling, for <i>equal</i> rights,
and <i>equal</i> justice <i>to all</i>.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I must now beg leave to retire, as my presence
is required, in a <i>more august</i> assembly. You know, your address
to the Magistrates for calling a meeting, &amp;c., was <i>headed</i> by
certain Protestant Ministers, and you know also, that most of
their fellow labourers in the vineyard, of the Protestant Church,
have been most <i>active</i>, and <i>zealous</i> in the <i>late</i> crusade against
the <i>Catholics</i>. Now, to pass over these reverend gentlemen with
<i>silent</i> contempt, would be, in my humble opinion, an act of great
<i>incivility</i>, and <i>disrespect</i> on <i>my</i> part; and which, <i>they</i> might
perhaps consider, <i>a most extraordinary</i>, and <i>presumptuous movement</i>,
on <i>my</i> part; I beg leave, gentlemen, therefore, to adjourn to
this <i>august</i> assembly, and as I shall have to show these reverend
gentlemen, what "an extraordinary and presumptuous movement,"
<i>their Protestant</i> Church, has been making, <i>for a long time</i>, on the
<i>pockets</i>, and on the <i>intellects</i> of Englishmen, I shall be very glad, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
you will accompany me, and see verified the poetical words of my

150,000,000, and that it would be difficult to shew that all the other Christian
sects united, amount, to 120,000,000. I quite agree with his words, "not
fewer," and "it would be difficult to shew;" for upon an accurate calculation, it
would be found that the Catholics amount nearer to 200,000,000, than to
150,000,000, and that all the other Christian sects, united into one body, are
nearer 100,000,000, than 120,000,000. However, Macaulay's statement is quite
sufficient to prove what we have cited it for, viz:&mdash;that the Roman Catholics
are the greatest body of Christians, and therefore have the best title to the ancient
and honourable name of Catholic.</p></div>

Church. Now, if this is not <i>our</i> Church, I would ask, what Church <i>is it</i>? Is it
the collection of sects which have sprung from the Reformation? But, then, it
would not be <i>Catholic</i>, for as they are the smaller number, they cannot claim
universality. Is it the Theological hodge-podge, the farrago of all the religions,
which believe in the Gospel? Then it cannot be <i>Holy</i>, for we should form the
<i>principal</i> part of it, and you know, the immaculate Church of England tells us,
our doctrines are idolatrous. I really think, people had better leave us in the
<i>quiet</i> possession of our old inheritance, the honourable and ancient name of
Catholic, and <i>then</i> they would avoid the above ridiculous consequences.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> I have sometimes been asked, and the question has sometimes been slyly
popped to me, and to others, by certain limbs of the law, if I was a <i>Jesuit</i>? I
answer first, that I have not the honour to belong to that learned, and much
calumniated body, the Jesuits. I answer secondly, I perfectly understood the
<i>sly</i> drift of these <i>questions</i>, and <i>inuendoes</i>. It was as good as to say, "Jesuitism
is a strange compound of all kinds of tricks and quirks, and of mental reservations,
and deceptions. Now this little spectacle fellow, is one of them, and
therefore, he is up to all the Jesuitical trade, and is a perfect specimen of it.
Nay, I believe, that he could slyly board us with his Jesuitical tricks, <i>even</i>
while we were looking on." Well, one good turn certainly deserves another.
And now, I must as politely as I can, tell these limbs of the law, that if I am to
judge of the law from the little, that I have really seen, and know about <i>them</i>,
and that if Jesuitism be <i>really</i>, what they <i>imagine</i> it is, and if the whole of
England ever became Catholic, and then, from Catholicism jumped to Jesuitism,
in this case, I certainly think that these limbs of the law, will not have to study,
the celestial arts of Jesuitism, as pourtrayed in their own imagination; for they
will be <i>already</i>, perfectly dubbed masters of Israel in that art, and they will
certainly occupy distinguished places, in the various departments of <i>mental
reservations</i>, pious frauds, and charitable tricks and quirks upon their neighbour's
pockets. Really this reminds me of Paddy, who had just arrived from
Ireland, and was <i>sneeringly</i> asked by a <i>busy</i> Englishman, what kind of a crop
of Murphies, they had had in Ireland? Pat had a shillalah in his hand, he up
with it, knocked down the Englishman, and said; "And sure your honour, we
have had a very good crop of Murphies, and you may know it by the feel,
for that is the stalk of one." Now, I hope these limbs of the law, will not be
offended at me for taking up my spectacle shillalah, and just politely flooring
them, for their <i>Jesuitical inuendoes</i> and <i>mental reservations</i> in my regard. I
hope they will not be offended, at my defending myself, for their own profession
will teach them, that every one is allowed fair play, whether he be a metamorphosed
calumniated Jesuit, or a limb of the law in the body of a man's pocket.
But far be it from me to adopt their extensive, and sweeping mode of argumentation,
viz., the law of the land is a heap of deceptions, and tricks, now such a
man is a lawyer, therefore he must be a sleight-of-hand gentleman in that art.
Before I make this sweeping conclusion, I ought <i>first</i>, to examine seriously,
and carefully, if the law <i>really is</i>, this strange compound of deceptions, and I
ought then, to examine and really know, that this lawyer has really acted
according to this deception, I ought to do this, before I condemn him personally,
or open the flood-gates of condemnation on the whole respectable body of
lawyers. This is the argumentation which reason and justice tell me I ought
to adopt. Now just let these limbs of the law, adopt this line of argumentation
with regard to Jesuitism and Jesuits, and then, they will be both limbs of
the law, and limbs of fair play.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_E_5" id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> But some one will perhaps inquire, does the Protestant Church consider
<i>your</i> Catholic Ministers <i>really</i> ordained? I reply she does, for were any
Catholic Priest to go over to the Protestant Church, she would not ordain him.
And why? Because the Protestant Church got her ordinations (if she has any)
from us, and to question <i>our</i> ordination, would be to strike at the foundation of

(Elizabeth) reigned for forty five years, and these forty-five years, were spent in
deeds of such cruelty, as the world had never heard of, or read of before; and all
for the purpose of compelling her people, to submit to this established (Protestant)
Church. With regard to the cruelties of this monster, in woman's shape, her
butcherings, her rippings up, her tearing out of the bowels of her subjects, her
torments of every description, in which she was always cordially supported, by
the lawgiving makers of the (Protestant) prayer book, I must refer the reader,
to my history of the Protestant reformation; suffice it to say (here), that in
these forty-five years, which were employed in the establishing of this Church,
there were more cruelty, more bloodshed, more suffering, than ever were witnessed
in the world, in any other country in a like period of time." (Cobbett's

<p>You cannot be <i>surprised</i>, that I have <i>not</i> taken
my text from the <i>Scripture</i>, for many of you tell the people, that
we <i>Catholic</i> Clergymen wish to conceal from the people that
sacred volume. To have, therefore, taken my text from the
<i>Scripture</i> for the <i>sake</i> of the <i>people</i>, would be like falsifying
your words, and to have quoted it for your instructions, would
have been most presumptuous on my part, as every one knows
you are masters of Israel, both in word and deed, in the knowledge
of that sacred volume. Had I, therefore, been so presumptuous
as to have quoted Scripture for <i>your</i> information, you
might have perhaps addressed me in the words of the Poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ye Popish blockheads, mitred Cambridge cries,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That <i>we</i> should claim monopoly of wit."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Well, among the great diffusion of biblical knowledge, which
has been so <i>gloriously</i> spread among the people by your Scriptural
Church, as by Law established, I happened one day <i>fortu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_2" id="Addr_2_Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>nately</i>
to hear, that you Reverends often told the people, that
there was a golden and heavenly rule in the Scriptures, viz.:&mdash;<i>that
they were never to do unto others, what they would not wish others
to do unto them</i>. Now we cannot for a moment suppose, that
like spiritual guide-posts, <i>you</i> would wish to inculcate this
golden rule to <i>others</i>, and not follow it <i>yourselves</i>. Well then,
you have been <i>lately</i> trying to arouse the indignation of the
people, by informing them in the most <i>dignified</i> manner, that
the Pope of Rome has just made a most "extraordinary, and presumptuous
movement" on the Protestants of England. Now
what shall we say, if it turn out, that you and <i>your Reverend</i>
Protestant ancestors, have for a long time been making a "most
extraordinary, and presumptuous movement" on the <i>pockets</i>, and
on the <i>intellects</i> of Englishmen?</p>

<p>Let us then proceed to examine <i>coolly</i>, and <i>calmly</i>, the above
points. I will endeavour, most Reverend Gentlemen, to discuss
these points with as much temper, and forbearance as I possibly
can. But, you must remember, that <i>you</i> and many of <i>your</i>
Reverend body, have been endeavouring to convict, <i>without
ceremony</i>, the <i>numerous</i> and <i>respectable</i> Catholic body of
England, of the crimes of wishing to extend their <i>popish spiritual</i>
and <i>temporal</i> domination over the Protestants of England.
For this purpose, your zealous and Reverend body have, with
pious industry, raked together the filth of ancient controversy,
and poured it <i>without mercy</i> on the heads of Catholics, and on
that Church, of which it is my pride to be a minister. Now,
Reverend Gentlemen, <i>you</i>, who deal so copiously in hard words,
certainly ought not to complain, if you should happen sometimes,
to meet with them in return. If <i>you</i> demand respect
from <i>others</i>, you ought certainly to respect a <i>more numerous
body</i> of Christians, (I mean the Catholic Christian world,) who
have no reason to think themselves, your inferiors in talent,
learning, or judgment. Well then, let us now proceed to the
discussion of the above two points.</p>

<p>Most Reverend Gentlemen, in a book (but <i>mind</i> not the
<i>Scripture</i>) called the <i>extraordinary</i> Black Book, published in
London in the year 1831, by Effingham Wilson, Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_3" id="Addr_2_Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Exchange, I find the following statement of the income of the
Church of England as by Law established. Of course, I am
aware, that certain changes have been made by Government
(since the publication of the above book) as to the amount of
individual incomes, but the <i>aggregate</i> sum is still absorbed by
the Protestant Church, as by Law established. Well then, in
the above-mentioned, extraordinary Black Book, I find the
various incomes of the Church of England there stated, and
would you believe it! they form a sum of money, <span class="small">TO THE TUNE</span>
<i>of nine millions, four hundred and fifty-two thousands, five hundred
and sixty-five pounds per annum</i>.</p>

<p>Now let us see, how well the Bishops, and Archbishops of the
Reformation, have thriven on the above <i>spiritual</i> food. The following
is an extract from the probate duty returns, and of
course, must be <i>real</i> testimony as to the <i>worth</i> of these <i>poor in
spirit</i> children, when they awoke "in that undiscovered country,
from whose bourne no traveller returns."</p>

</table>

<p>Now just add up the above items, and then, you will see that
these <i>Protestant</i> Bishops and Archbishops, <i>after</i> maintaining
themselves, their wives and families, left <i>behind</i> them, according
to the probate duty returns, <i>no less than the enormous sum of
two millions and seventy-five thousand pounds sterling</i>. Really,
when these <i>mammon-godly</i> souls entered the gates of heaven,
with all these paraphernalia of gold, how amazed must the celes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_4" id="Addr_2_Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>tial
inmates have been! They would wonder whence these
<i>golden</i> spirits came, but of this they would be convinced, that
they must have come from the land of the <i>living</i>, and had certainly
<i>piously</i> reformed the words of the Scripture, "Blessed
are the poor in spirit," and really verified the words of my text,
"What a <i>marvellous</i> project is faith, and a <i>merry</i> jest
withal!"</p>

<p>So far, Reverend Gentlemen, I think the people will begin to
conclude, that your Reverend body has, for some time, been
making a most "extraordinary and presumptuous movement" on
the <i>pockets</i> of Englishmen, and would to heaven! I could stop
here. But I must <i>now</i> show the people of England, that <i>your
Protestant</i> Church as by Law established, is receiving more
money by <i>four hundred and fifty-three thousands, five hundred
and sixty-five pounds</i>, than all the other Christian churches in the
<i>whole</i> world. The above <i>extraordinary</i> Black Book, gives a
scale of the <i>comparative</i> expenses of the Church of <i>England</i>, and
of all the other <i>Christian</i> churches in the <i>whole</i> world. Now by this
scale, it is shown that the <i>total</i> income of all the Christian
churches in the various parts of the world, is eight millions
nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand pounds; and the above
scale shows, that the income of the Church of <i>England</i>, is nine
millions, four hundred and fifty-two thousands, five hundred and
sixty-five pounds. Now, if you will just place the <i>smaller</i> of these
under the <i>larger</i> number, and subtract the one from the other,
you will see that the <i>income</i> of the Protestant Church <i>in England</i>,
exceeds the total income of <i>all</i> the other <i>Christian</i> churches
in the whole world, by <i>four hundred and fifty-three thousands, five
hundred and sixty-five pounds</i>. Oh, mighty England! thou boastest,
<i>and justly</i>, that thy majestic fleet rides on the waves, the triumphant
mistress of the seas; and thou mayest also <i>as truly</i>, but
not <i>so justly</i>, boast, that thy <i>Scriptural</i> Church, as by Law
<i>established</i>, rides triumphant on the <i>golden</i> waves of <i>mammon</i>,
and that she is <i>really mistress</i> of the world, <i>in point of mammon</i>;
she is <i>truly</i> the <i>grand</i> and <i>golden</i> emporium of <i>clerical</i>
incomes. Oh, how justly may the ministers of this Church,
address her, as their golden calf, in these words of the Scripture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_5" id="Addr_2_Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
"Where <i>thou</i> goest, <i>I</i> will go; and where <i>thou</i> lodgest, <i>I</i> will
lodge; and <i>thy</i> people shall be <i>my</i> people." (Ruth i. 16.) "Yea!
and we will kill the fatted calf, and slay the rams, and make
<i>merry</i>." (Prov. v. 9.)</p>

<p>But you will reply, we got all this money from <i>you papists</i>.
Yes, courteous clerks, to the <i>honour</i> of the Catholic Church be
it said, that all this money was left by our <i>charitable</i> ancestors;
and I will now judge you from <i>your own</i> mouths. <i>Mind</i> and
<i>mark it well</i>, that in the <i>Catholic</i> times of old England, the
above sums of money were divided into <i>three</i> parts: <i>one</i> for
the maintenance of the clergy, the <i>second</i> for the repair of the
churches, and the <i>third</i> for the support of the <i>poor</i>. In those
good old <i>Catholic</i> times, there were no church-rates, nor poor-rates.
But your <i>god-like</i> church as by law established, thought
it more just, or at least <i>convenient</i>, to pocket <i>herself</i> the <i>whole</i>
of the above sum, and to leave to the <i>public</i> the charitable office,
of providing for the other <i>two</i> purposes. Really, Most Reverend
Gentlemen, I candidly appeal to you, if this was not "a
most extraordinary and presumptuous movement" of your
clerical ancestors on the <i>pockets</i> of the people; and <i>really</i>, must
not people of the <i>present</i> day think it "a most extraordinary
and presumptuous movement" on the part of you Reverend
Gentlemen, to continue these <i>pious</i> frauds, and <i>godly</i> practices of
your ancestors? In <i>this</i>, at least, you <i>fully</i> observe the commands
of the <i>Scripture</i>, "Remove not the landmark of thy
forefathers." Oh ye poor! (whom I sincerely love for the sake
of my Saviour,) when I enter your hovels, where sickness,
misery, and want meet together, and witness the scenes of
distress that are passing there;&mdash;when I see a few handfuls of
dying embers, that are calculated rather to starve you, than
afford you the necessary comforts of warmth;&mdash;when I see the
bed of wretchedness, on which you cast your wearied limbs;&mdash;when
I view the tattered clothes, which scarcely cover you
decently, much less protect you from the inclemency of the
weather;&mdash;when I behold your pale and sickly countenances,
that bespeak the poorness and scarcity of your food;&mdash;when I
view your poor little children, begging in vain, with tears of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_6" id="Addr_2_Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
artless innocence, a morsel of bread to satisfy the cravings of
hunger;&mdash;when I witness scenes of this heart-rending description,
(scenes which are not very uncommon now-a-days), the
<i>charity</i> of our <i>Catholic</i> ancestors, and the <i>inhumanity</i> of <i>your</i>
Church as by law established, rush vividly on my mind, and call
to my recollection the words of our Saviour, "Come, ye blessed
of My Father, possess ye the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and you gave me
to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink. I was a
stranger, and you took me in; naked, and you covered me;
sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me.
Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand:
Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, which was
prepared for the devil, and his angels. For I was hungry,
and you gave me not to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me not
to drink. I was a stranger, and you took me not in; naked,
and you covered me not; sick and in prison, and you did not
visit me. Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when
did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or
sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee? Then he shall
answer them, saying: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it
not to one of these least," (namely the poor), "neither did you
do it to me." (St. Matt. xxv. 34 to 45.) Oh how <i>strikingly</i> does
the <i>first</i> part of this sacred passage apply to <i>our charitable</i>
Catholic ancestors? But shall I apply the second part to <i>you</i>,
or <i>your</i> Protestant ancestors? Oh! heaven forbid I should!
I say with the great St. Paul, I judge no man; but charity for
you, and the poor, induce me to entreat of you, and to ask of God
to give you His grace, to commence a real reform in your <i>church
property</i>, for the <i>sake</i> of the <i>poor</i>, and to restore to the <i>poor</i>,
what your Protestant ancestors so <i>unjustly</i> took from them.</p>

<p>But you will perhaps reply, that all this church property, has
been <i>justly</i> given to your Protestant Church, by the <i>law</i> of the
<i>land</i>; for as the law of the land, <i>justly</i> secures <i>to the landlord,
his rents</i>, so the law of the land, <i>justly</i> secures to <i>your church,
the tithes</i>. I answer, in the first place, that by no law, either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_7" id="Addr_2_Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
human, or divine, can property be <i>justly</i> applied to any <i>other</i>
purpose, than to <i>that</i> for which the <i>intention</i> of the testator left
it. Now one-third of this church property, was left by our
<i>Catholic</i> ancestors, for the support of the <i>poor</i>; and <i>as long</i> as
this property, was in the hands of the <i>Catholic Church</i>, the poor
always received <i>their just</i> share. Hence, among <i>all</i> the calumnies
against the <i>Catholic</i> Church, even her <i>basest</i> enemies,
could <i>never</i> accuse her of <i>injustice to the poor</i>. I answer
secondly, the law of the land, as to <i>landlords</i>, is a <i>good</i> law,
because the landlord gives to his tenant <i>value</i> (viz., the use of
the land) for what he (the landlord) receives; whereas the law
of tithes is a <i>bad</i> law, because it often exacts tithes, where the
payer has never received, <i>one farthing</i> of value from the <i>parson</i>.
Now in this case, it does appear to me (and I am sure it must to
many others) most unjust to demand it <i>from persons</i>, who never
received a <i>pin's-worth</i> of good, from <i>your</i> ministry in their lives.
Nay, perhaps the <i>only return</i> they got, for the payment of their
tithes was, to hear their religion <i>abused</i>, and to be held up before
the public, as guilty of those <i>very</i> crimes, which <i>these</i> reverends
<i>themselves</i> were <i>really</i> committing, either by their robbing the
poor of their just share, or by unjustly exacting from <i>others</i>
money, for which the <i>payers</i> had never received one farthing of
value.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>And now, most Reverend Gentlemen, I must just let the people
see, how you contrive to blind them, by throwing <i>popish</i> dust
into their eyes. All the noise, which you make, <i>about the pope's
bulls, and about popish spiritual and temporal domination</i>, is a
mere <i>ruse de guerre</i> of <i>many</i> of you, (some of you indeed, I
believe, are sincere in your motives, and actions,) to divert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_9" id="Addr_2_Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
<i>public</i> attention, from the <i>great temporalities</i> of the established
Church. You call, and hold your public and glorious meetings.
With upturned hands and eyes, with high-<i>souled</i> strains of
<i>devotional</i> eloquence, with cordial community of feeling, got up
between the <i>established</i> Church, and <i>those</i> whom you indeed
honour <i>with your lips</i> by the title of reverends, but whom, <i>in
your hearts</i>, you deem <i>mere phantoms</i> of ministers, with silvery
tones, and well-turned periods, of <i>rag-tag</i> and <i>bob-tail</i> inspirations;
you excite the breathless attention of your audience, and profess
the <i>most sanctified</i> attachment to your <i>godly</i> Church, and to
your glorious Constitution, under the protection of whose wing,
<i>you</i> are <i>slyly</i> basking in the sunshine of <i>godly</i> mammon, and
<i>worldly</i> wealth. Should any poor <i>Catholic</i>, or <i>charitable dissenter</i>,
(who wishes <i>you</i> to <i>do</i> to <i>others</i> as <i>you</i> would be <i>done</i>
by,) obtrude himself on the notice of your meeting, a thundering
philippic is <i>instantly</i> raised against <i>popery</i>, and gaining strength
and speed, and loudness in its progress, rumbles onward, until
at last, it bursts forth into a <i>tremendous</i> elemental roar, increased
by the zealous acclamations of an enraptured and fanatical
audience. Oh, most Reverend Gentlemen, this is really a <i>glorious</i>,
and <i>very profitable</i> humbug. <i>As long</i> as <i>you</i> can manage,
to keep the people in <i>this feverish state of excitement</i>, the gulls
will think more of <i>discussing pope's</i> bulls, <i>Guy Fawkes's, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_10" id="Addr_2_Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Gunpowder Plots</i>, than of <i>questioning</i> the <i>moral</i> basis of the
law, which entitles <i>you</i> to take from <i>the poor</i>, their <i>just</i> share of
<i>Church</i> property, left by <i>our charitable</i> ancestors, and of exacting
tithes and Church-rates from <i>those</i>, who do not belong to
<i>your</i> flock, and <i>for whom you do nothing in return</i>. Thus, you
<i>successfully</i> stave off the <i>discussion of Church</i> property, professing
all the while, the most <i>devotional</i> concern for the <i>spiritual</i>
welfare of <i>the gulls</i>, on whose <i>pockets</i>, you are making a most
'extraordinary, and presumptuous movement.' Thus <i>you</i> reap the
<i>profits</i>, and <i>laugh</i> at the <i>fools</i>, who are <i>cajoled</i> by <i>your grand</i>
displays. Really, most Reverend Gentlemen, this extraordinary
and presumptuous conduct, does, in my humble opinion, <i>beat all
the powers of impudence</i>.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p>Most Reverend Gentlemen, I have now proved "the extraordinary
and presumptuous movement," which <i>your scriptural</i>
Church as by law established, has been making for a long time
on the <i>pockets</i> of Englishmen. I must now proceed to show,
what "a most extraordinary and presumptuous movement" she
has been making for a long time, on the <i>intellects</i> of Englishmen.
Would to God that occasion had never been given to me to
touch on <i>this</i> subject! But remember, that <i>many</i> of your
<i>reverend</i> body, have been <i>publicly</i> advancing the most <i>pretty</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_11" id="Addr_2_Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<i>polite</i> things against <i>us Catholics</i>. The newspapers, will bear
ample testimony to the <i>strange</i>, and <i>horrid</i> things, which <i>many</i>
of your <i>reverends</i>, have <i>lately</i> uttered against the Catholic
Church. Now, what they have in general uttered against us,
is, <i>unfortunately</i>, <i>not</i> founded on <i>truth</i>; but mind, what I shall
advance is <i>really true</i>, although <i>most awful</i>, nay <i>almost</i> incredible,
had not your <i>Protestant</i> testimonies borne <i>ample</i> witness
<i>to it</i>. Remember, also, that although Our Saviour was the <i>most</i>
meek, and kind creature that the world <i>ever</i> beheld, <i>still</i>, when
the <i>honour</i> of His Heavenly Father was <i>insulted</i> and <i>outraged</i>,
He cast the buyers and sellers out of the Temple. Now, some
of your reverend body, have, in my ideas, lately used all their
endeavours to insult, and outrage the Catholic Church, which, I
consider, the Temple of God. Pardon me, therefore, if I should
with the spiritual arms of <i>truth</i>, (and I hope of <i>charity</i>,) cast
<i>them</i> out of that temple, and show the world, they had <i>better</i>
have been in <i>their own</i> temple, and have tried to have <i>re</i>formed
<i>it</i>, <i>before</i> they had endeavoured to turn masters of Israel, in
their <i>neighbours'</i> temple.</p>

<p>But <i>this</i>, Reverend Gentlemen, I must say, that if the Catholic
Church, had <i>no better</i> foundation than <i>declamation</i> against the
<i>Protestant</i> Church, I would not be either a <i>minister</i>, or a <i>member</i>
of it for a <i>single</i> day. But mind, the Catholic Church has both
a <i>good</i> foundation, and can also show the <i>flimsy</i> texture of the
<i>Protestant</i> Church, when Protestant ministers are so <i>imprudent</i>
as to attack her.</p>

<p>Most Reverend Gentlemen, I can only say, had <i>you</i> remained
quiet, <i>I</i> should have been <i>innocent</i> of the disagreeable task, of
having to state the following <i>awful</i> facts. But as <i>you</i> have not,
I can only add, I am <i>innocent</i> of the consequences, look <i>you</i> to
them. I will not indeed exclaim, with the Scripture, "Its blood
be upon you, and upon your children;" but I will rather say, in
the spirit of charity, may it bring you, and your followers, to a
serious consideration, and to a sense of duty. But some of you
reverends will <i>perhaps</i> infer, from the awful truths which I shall
advance, that I must believe that all, who are not of <i>our</i> communion,
must go to hell. <i>Appalling sentence!</i> Christ certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_12" id="Addr_2_Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
has said, that he that will not hear the Church, is to be to us as
a heathen and a publican (that is, excluded from our spiritual
communion.) But Christ does not say, he will <i>go to hell</i>, much
less, therefore, ought <i>I</i> to <i>rashly</i> condemn him. St. Paul, also,
warns us to judge <i>no man</i>, for this good reason, because <i>we, also</i>
shall have to stand before the tribunal of Christ. Far, therefore,
be it from me to open the flood-gates of damnation, even
on a <i>single</i> individual, much less on the <i>whole</i> body of our
Protestant brethren. Although, therefore, I shall shortly advance
truths, most awful, and almost incredible, still, let no one
imagine, I mean anything <span class="small">PERSONAL</span>. Oh, no, I will say with the
poet&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Well, then, let it be remembered, that I shall advance only
undeniable facts, without intending to deal damnation <i>on you</i>,
or on the <i>whole</i> Protestant body.</p>

<p>A certain Spanish chemist, thought that <i>God's</i> formation of
his master, had not been executed in the most perfect, and durable
manner; and this chemist had the audacious presumption
to imagine, that if he demolished his master, he could raise him
to life again, to a more perfect, and durable specimen of workmanship,
than he was, when God first made him. For this
purpose, this audacious chemist cut his master into pieces, and
put the various parts into his sublimatory glass, with the design
of raising his master again, by chemical operation, to a more
durable, and perfect state of life than he was, when he was the
handiwork of <i>God's</i> formation. Now, Most Reverend Gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_13" id="Addr_2_Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>men,
I will not apply this to your Church, but <i>this</i> I will do, I
will show you what the Church <i>was</i>, and <i>is</i>, which the fathers of
the Reformation wished first to demolish, on account of her
imperfections, and then, to raise her again to a more perfect
specimen of spiritual life; I will show the characters of these
spiritual chemists; I will show you the wonderful works of their
spiritual chemistry, and the wonderful spiritual works of their
scriptural hands; and then, I will leave you, and others to judge,
whether these first reformers, and these new soul menders, <i>did,
or did not</i>, really imitate the strange, and presumptuous conduct
of this Spanish chemist.</p>

<p>When God first created man, He imprinted on his heart the
light of reason, which (whether aided by revelation or not, it is
not necessary here to enquire) taught him his duty to his God,
to his neighbour, and to himself. This light was also imprinted
on the hearts of his descendants; but as man fell from God by
sin, the light of this natural law was greatly impaired, both in
the hearts of our <i>first</i> parents, and of all <i>their</i> descendants.
The light of this natural law, though much impaired by Adam's
fall, is, and ever has been, imprinted on the hearts of all,
and is, and ever has been, the foundation of all moral rectitude.
The imperfection of this natural law was, before our Saviour
came, supplied by the aid of revelation, which Almighty God
communicated to mankind, at various times, through His chosen
servants. But at <i>last</i>, the Almighty was pleased to send His
only Son from heaven to earth, to supply the deficiency of this
natural law, and to teach mankind, in the most perfect manner,
their duty to God, to their neighbour, and to themselves.
Hence our Saviour beautifully says, "He came <i>not</i> to destroy
the law, but to fulfil it," that is, He came to supply the imperfections
of the natural law, caused by Adam's fall, and to teach
us, in the most perfect manner, our duty to our God, to our
neighbour, and to ourselves. Hence, for this purpose He became
man, and united our humanity to His divinity. In this
God-man, were concentrated all the treasures of divine wisdom
and knowledge; and to this God-man, were given all power in
heaven, and on earth. It is plain, therefore, as our Saviour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_14" id="Addr_2_Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
beautifully says, He came to be the way, the truth, and the life
to all mankind; that is, He came to be the way, by showing us
the true way of heaven, which had been darkened, and obscured
by the sin of our first parents; He came to be the truth, by
revealing to us those supernatural truths, which the natural law
did not reveal, and by revealing to us more clearly those truths,
which the natural law revealed only obscurely; and lastly, He
came to be our life, by communicating to mankind His graces,
by which they were enabled to <i>practise</i> the truths, which this
divine law <i>taught</i>, and thus, by the <i>knowledge</i>, and <i>faithful
practice</i> of this divine law, to arrive at last at the kingdom of
heaven. Hence, fully sensible of this truth, the Apostles are
continually in the Scriptures reminding us, on <i>the one hand</i>, of
man's fall, and the sad consequences of that fall; and <i>on the other
hand</i>, of our liberation from sin, and of the abundant blessings
we have received, by redemption through Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Now, that mankind <i>in every age</i>, might be partakers of these
abundant, and spiritual blessings, Jesus Christ was pleased to
found a Church, and to invest this Church with the same spiritual
powers, which He had received from His heavenly Father.
This Church, <i>through Jesus Christ</i>, was to be the <i>infallible</i>
source of all spiritual knowledge, and of all spiritual grace; in
short, it was to be the <i>visible</i>, the <i>infallible</i>, and <i>the incorruptible</i>
Church of all ages, with the world for its boundaries, and
time for its duration.</p>

<p>I will now, give you a short description of this Church of
Christ; attend, and I will tell you, in as few words as I can,
what this Church always <i>was</i>, and really <i>is</i>. Catholicity, or
Christ's Church, began with our Saviour, received her mission,
her powers, and her doctrine, from Jesus Christ. She has been
distinguished in every age, for the unity of her faith, and the
sanctity of her doctrine, for the universality of her extent, and
the apostolicity of her origin. No <i>earthly</i> consideration, could
ever induce her, to swerve <i>one iota</i> from the sacred deposit, and
unity of faith, delivered to her by Jesus Christ. Hence, whenever
she found any in her communion, either layman, priest, or
bishop, or <i>even a whole nation</i>, wishing to <i>change</i>, or <i>add to</i>, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_15" id="Addr_2_Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
diminish <i>one tittle</i> of the <i>faith</i>, delivered by her heavenly
founder, she <i>at first</i>, like a tender mother, expostulated with
them, appealed to the grounds and truth of her faith, and traced
it to the mouth, either of our Saviour or His Apostles; but if
they disregarded her tender expostulations, she then, as St. Paul
did the incestuous Corinthian, cut them off from her communion,
and showed them, when <i>her faith</i> was at stake, she feared
neither the <i>frowns</i> of individuals, nor the <i>strength</i> of nations.
Every article of her faith is so holy in itself, and so conducive
to true holiness, that she challenges her greatest adversaries, to
show the <i>smallest stain</i> in any part of what she <i>really</i> teaches,
and the most convincing proof of their being <i>unable</i> to do so, is,
that not daring to attack her <i>true</i> doctrine, they, by calumny
and misrepresentation, lay things to her charge which she even
<i>detests</i> and <i>condemns</i>.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> And then, after combating a <i>phantom</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_16" id="Addr_2_Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
of their <i>own</i> creation, exult in an easy and decisive victory.
From the dawn of Christianity to the present day, there has not
been a nation converted to Christianity, but what was converted
by her zealous exertions, nor is there a religion under the sun
except hers, that can prove that any of her members, were ever
honoured on account of their virtues, and sanctity, with the name
of saint. She can look back through eighteen centuries, and
shew that the unity and sanctity of her doctrine, are the <i>very
same</i> in the <i>nineteenth</i> century, as they were in the <i>first</i> century.
She can trace a long succession of popes, even to the first pope,
who was St. Peter. She can present you a long catalogue of
learned and polite nations, of scholars, philosophers, and divines,
of generals, statesmen, and princes, of saints, martyrs, and confessors,
who looked upon her faith as their best inheritance, a
treasure which they held more dear than life itself. In short,
she can prove, that she is <i>now</i> that Church, which <i>our Saviour
first</i> founded on a rock, against which, He promised, that the
gates of hell should never prevail, and that He, and His Holy
Spirit, should remain with it, teaching it all truth, <i>until the end
of the world</i>. Hence, she has passed through the stormy trials
of <i>eighteen</i> centuries, which would have long since shivered
any <i>human</i> institution into atoms, and now stands forth, ever
fresh and vigorous, in all her pristine strength, but silvered with
the venerable hoar of ages.</p>

<p>This is a short description of the visible, infallible, and incorruptible
Catholic Church of Christ; I will now show you how
this Church was formed, and how it was to be perpetuated, <i>from
age to age</i>, with the world for its boundaries, and time for its
duration. The Prophet Daniel foresaw this Church, when he
said (Dan. c. ii.), "The God of heaven should set up a kingdom,
which should <i>never</i> be destroyed." And our Saviour (Matt. xvi.)
informs us, that He is the maker and builder of this Church.
Hence He assures us, that as He Himself was sent by His
Heavenly Father to preach the Gospel (Luke iv. 18.), so He, also,
sent His Apostles: as My Father hath sent Me, I also send you.
(John xx. 21.) For this purpose He revealed to His Apostles <i>all</i>
the divine truths which <i>He</i> had received. "All things," says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_17" id="Addr_2_Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
He, "whatsoever I have heard of My Father, I have made known
to you." (John xv. 15.) He then gave them a commission, to
teach <i>all</i> these truths to <i>all</i> nations. "All power," says He, "is
given to me in heaven and on earth: go ye, therefore, and teach
all nations, teaching them to observe <i>all</i> things whatsoever <i>I</i>
have commanded you; and behold I am with you <i>all days, even
to the end of the world</i>." (Matt. xxviii. 19, 20.) But when our
Saviour gave these commands to His Apostles, He at the same
time, imposed upon mankind a strict obligation, <i>to hear</i> and <i>learn</i>
His gospel from the Apostles. Hence He says to His Apostles,
"He that heareth <i>you</i>, heareth <i>Me</i>, and he that despiseth <i>you</i>,
despiseth <i>Me</i>, and he that despiseth <i>Me</i>, despiseth <i>Him</i> that
sent me." (Luke x. 16.) But whilst our Saviour, imposes upon
mankind the necessity of <i>hearing</i> His Apostles, he pledged His
<i>infallible</i> word, that they should <i>never</i> lead <i>the people</i> astray, or
teach any false doctrine. For this reason, He promises that He
will send down His Holy Spirit upon the Apostles, to teach them
all truth, that He and His Holy Spirit will remain with them
<i>for ever</i>, teaching them all truth, and that the gates of hell shall
not prevail against them. (John xv. Matt. xvi.)</p>

<p>That this <i>absolute</i>, and <i>infallible</i> authority of preaching and
teaching, was not to be limited merely to the <i>persons</i> of the
Apostles, nor merely to the <i>period</i> of their ministry, but was
also to extend to <i>their</i> successors in office, and <i>to all future ages</i>,
I will now prove. Our Saviour tells His Apostles, that they are
to go, and teach <i>all nations</i>, and that He will be with them, <i>even
until the end of the world</i>; and that the Spirit of truth, shall
remain with them <i>for ever</i>. Now, as the Apostles, <i>did not</i> teach
<i>all nations</i>, in their <i>own</i> persons, and were not to continue on
earth, until <i>the end of the world</i>, it was manifest, that the commission
was not to be confined to <i>their persons</i>, but was to be
given to <i>their office</i>, that is, to them and their successors <i>in
office</i>, who shall continue <i>until the end of the world</i>, to <i>complete</i>
the great work of teaching all nations, which the Apostles <i>first
began</i>. That this was <i>actually</i> the intention of <i>our divine
Saviour</i>, we learn in positive, and distinct terms, from these words
of St. Paul: "And He gave some apostles, and some prophets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_18" id="Addr_2_Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
and other some pastors, and doctors for the perfecting of the
saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body
of Christ." "That henceforth we may be no more children,
tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine,
by the wickedness of men, by cunning craftiness, by which they
lie in wait to deceive." (iv. 11, 14.) <i>Such is</i>, most Reverend
Gentlemen, and <i>such always was, the visible, the infallible, and
incorruptible</i> Church of Christ, which was to be perpetuated
<i>from age to age</i>, with time for its duration, and the world for its
boundaries.</p>

<p>Oh, but you will reply, this Church once fell into error, at
least so say the first Reformers. If, most Reverend Gentlemen,
I were to assert that <i>you</i> all once committed <i>murder</i>, you would
very sharply ask, <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>, and <i>how</i>? And if I could not
prove <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>, and <i>how</i>, I think you would deem me (and
justly too) a very near relation to the father of lies. Now, your
first Reformers <i>said</i>, indeed, that the Catholic Church once fell,
but <i>most unfortunately</i>, they <i>forgot</i> to prove <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>, and
<i>how</i>. As, therefore, these first Reformers, forgot to prove these
<i>most essential</i> circumstances, you must excuse <i>us Catholics</i>, if
we prefer <i>God's infallible</i> word, to the <i>mere ipse dixit</i> of these
<i>first celestial</i> lights of the Reformation. You know God says,
heaven and earth, <i>shall</i> pass away, but His word <i>shall not</i> pass
away.</p>

<p>But you will, perhaps, answer, really they must have been
<i>strange</i> beings to have <i>asserted</i>, that <i>God's infallible</i> Church had
fallen, and <i>not</i> to have been able, or at least to have <i>forgotten,
to prove</i> such a bold assertion. Do you know, I was just thinking
the same; and, therefore, I beg to introduce a few of these
beings to your notice: and I know <i>none</i>, that has a greater claim
to our first notice, than Martin Luther, <i>both</i> for the <i>originality</i>
of his spiritual doctrines, and for the <i>sublimity</i> of the <i>celestial</i>
revelations, with which he was honoured. And <i>mind</i>, had not
Luther and his disciples, left the most <i>incontestible</i> testimony of
what I am about to advance, it would really have outraged and
defied <i>all credibility</i>.</p>

<p>Well, then, know, and <i>never forget</i>, that Martin Luther, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_19" id="Addr_2_Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
first luminary of the Reformation, had a conference <i>with the
devil</i>, in which Martin assures us, that he was convinced by the
<i>devil's powerful</i> argumentation, that the Popish Mass was a
heap of idolatry. The following are the words of this angel of
<i>light</i> on this subject: "Being awakened at midnight, the devil
began to dispute with me, according to his custom. "Listen to
me, Master Doctor," said he: "do you consider that, for fifteen
years, you have said mass almost every day? What, if all this
while, you have been guilty of idolatry, and, instead of adoring
the body and blood of Christ, have adored only bread and wine?"
I answered him, that I was a priest lawfully ordained by the
bishop; and that having, from a principle of obedience, discharged
my ministry with a sincere intention of consecrating, I
saw no reason to doubt the validity of the consecration. "True,"
replied Satan; "but in the Churches of Turks and Heathens, is
not everything done in an orderly manner, and in the spirit of
obedience? Does that authorize their worship as orthodox, and
perfectly correct? What, if your ordination were null, and your
consecration as vain and useless as that of Turkish priests, in
the exercise of their ministry, or of the false prophets under
Jeroboam?" Here (adds Luther) I was seized with a violent
sweat, and my heart began to beat in a strange manner. The
devil is very artful in adjusting his reasoning, and he also pushes
his arguments with great force; he has a voice, strong and
rough, and is so pressing in his objections, one after another, as
scarcely to allow you time to breathe. Hence, I can conceive,
how it has repeatedly happened, that persons have, in the morning,
been found dead in their beds. In the first place, he may
suffocate them; he may also, by his method of disputing, cause
such a trouble in the soul as to render her unable to make any
further resistance, and thus she may be compelled instantly to
leave the body; which has nearly been my own case, more than
once."</p>

<p>After this preface, Luther mentions five reasons which the
devil alleged against the sacrifice of the mass; reasons extremely
frivolous in themselves, but which Luther considered of sufficient
weight to justify his yielding to them, saying to those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_20" id="Addr_2_Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
might blame his conduct, that "if <i>they</i> had heard the devil
reasoning in the same forcible manner as <i>he</i> had done, they
would take care not to appeal from his arguments to the practice
of the Church, and the usages of antiquity, which would
never satisfy them." This conference may be seen in three
different editions of Luther's works, printed by the care of his
disciples, viz., (Wittemberg, T. 7, p. 479. Jen, Ed. Germ. per
Thomas, p. 82. Attenberg, T. 6. p. 86.)</p>

<p>Really, most Reverend Gentlemen, this is a very strange history.
<i>Certain</i>, however, <i>it is</i>, that <i>Luther</i> omits <i>nothing</i> to persuade
us of its truth: for he mentions the very words which the
devil used, the tone of his voice, the nature of his arguments,
the impression which the conference made on his body and soul,
which sometimes follow from debating with this king of the
lower regions.</p>

<p>After the death of Luther, his disciples, and especially
Melancton, took care to insert the conference in the collection of
Luther's works, printed in Latin at Wittemberg, and the writers
of the Luthern and Calvinistic party agree, that it was <i>certainly
the production of Luther</i>.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> (Hospinian, par. 2. Hist. Sacramentari,
p. 26, et. p. 131.)</p>

<p>Now Luther either <i>had</i> or <i>had not</i> this conference with
the master of lies. If he <i>really had</i>, Luther ought to have
known, that <i>such</i> a master was not very likely, to teach him
anything <i>very good</i>, and that he was not a very <i>fit</i> person, to
convince him of the idolatry of the mass. For if the mass,
had <i>really</i> been idolatry, I think the devil, would <i>rather</i> have
encouraged, <i>than</i> tried to overturn it. But if Luther <i>had not</i>
this conference, then the ambition of Luther, for having wished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_21" id="Addr_2_Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
appear connected with so bad a master, indicates so strange and
exotic a genius, so depraved and bad a taste, that it reflects
<i>almost</i> as much dishonour on Luther, as if this conference had
really taken place.</p>

<p>You will perhaps object "that Luther is nothing to us."
Most Reverend Gentlemen, I have not quoted him to insult you,
or to throw any disrespect on you; for <i>you</i> are certainly not to
be <i>answerable</i> for Luther's <i>deeds</i>. But I have quoted him to let
you see, what kind of a genius, this father of the Reformation was,
and I must now candidly ask, if you think he was <i>a fit</i> person, to
reform Christ's Church. Had he indeed begun, by endeavouring
to <i>reform</i> the devil himself, we might have pardoned his religious
enthusiasm; but for him to tell us, that the <i>infallible</i> Church of
Christ, had fallen into error, and that he had come to reform it,
under the instructions, and guidance of the master of lies, is
<i>really</i> most outrageous, and cannot be equalled by any thing,
that I have either heard, or read on this side the grave. That
the human mind, should be capable of falling into such dreadful
delusion, would appear almost incredible, had not the Holy Ghost
assured us, that God abandons to a reprobate sense, those who
wish to change <i>truth</i> into <i>falsehood</i>. (Romans i. 25-26.)</p>

<p>Zuinglius, another bright son of the Reformation, professes to
have learnt his main argument against the Real Presence from a
spirit, which appeared to him in the night, but whether it was a
<i>black</i>, or <i>white</i> spirit he does not remember. However, he made
great account, of this nightly instruction of his <i>unknown</i> friend;
read the place of Exodus, which had been pointed out to him by
his <i>unknown</i> friend, and afterwards preached before the whole
congregation, on the subject of this <i>wonderful</i> discovery. (Hosp.
ii. p. 25-26.) Luther was positive and sure, that the devil, whom
&OElig;colampadius, (another reformer,) employed, strangled him
during the night in his bed. "This is the excellent master,"
continues Luther, "who taught &OElig;colampadius that there are
contradictions in the Scripture. See," says Luther, "to what
satan brings learned men." (De Miss. Priv. Luth.)</p>

<p>Such were the nocturnal revelations, with which some of the
first reformers were honoured, and I think now, you will not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_22" id="Addr_2_Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
surprised at the following character, which is given <i>them</i>, and
the <i>other</i> reformers, <i>even</i> by <i>Protestant</i> testimony. Zanchius,
the celebrated Protestant professor, thus complains of the conduct
of his <i>reforming Protestant</i> colleagues: "I am indignant,
when I consider the manner, in which most of us defend our
cause. The <i>true</i> state of the question we often, on <i>set</i> purpose,
involve in <i>darkness</i>, that it may not be <i>understood</i>; we have the
impudence, to <i>deny</i> things the <i>most evident</i>: we <i>assert</i> what is
<i>visibly</i> false: the most <i>impious</i> doctrines, we <i>force</i> on the people
as the <i>first</i> principles of <i>faith</i>, and <i>orthodox</i> (true) opinions, we
condemn as <i>heretical</i>: we <i>torture</i> the Scriptures, until they agree
with our <i>own</i> fancies, and boast of being the <i>disciples</i> of the
<i>fathers</i>, while we refuse <i>to follow their</i> doctrines: <i>to deceive</i>, <i>to
calumniate</i>, <i>to abuse</i>, is our <i>familiar</i> practice: nor do we care
for anything, <i>provided</i> we can defend our cause, <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i>,
<i>right</i> or <i>wrong</i>. Oh what times! what manners! (Zanchius
ad Stormium, tome viii. col. 828.)</p>

<p>"But <i>forgery</i>&mdash;I blush for the <i>honour</i> of Protestantism while
I write it&mdash;seems to have been <i>peculiar</i> to the <i>reformed</i> *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
and I look <i>in vain</i>, <i>for one</i> of these accursed outrages of imposition,
among <i>the disciples</i> of Popery." "But <i>forgery</i>, appears to
have been the <i>peculiar</i> disease of <i>Protestantism</i>."&mdash;(<i>Vindication
of Mary, Queen of Scots</i>, vol. iii. p. 2 and 53. <i>By the Rev. John
Whitaker, B.D., Rector of Ruan Langhorne, Cornwall.</i>)</p>

<p>You have now seen, who was the instructor of <i>some</i> of the first
Reformers, and the two above passages (<i>mind, from Protestants</i>,)
must convince you, that <i>they</i> and <i>their</i> reforming Protestant
colleagues, appear to have been apt scholars of this master of
lies. Well, I have shown you now, the character of the spiritual
chemists of the Reformation. I will now show you, some of
the wonderful <i>spiritual</i> works, of some of their <i>supernatural</i>, and
chemical hands.</p>

<p>Among these, I must rank as <i>first</i> and foremost, the wonderful
spiritual deeds, of your Scriptural Church as by Law
established. Most Reverend Gentlemen, The Thirty-nine
Articles, are the fundamental Articles of your Protestant Creed.
Now, in the Thirty-fifth of those Articles, I find, that your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_23" id="Addr_2_Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Scriptural Church professes to believe, in the Protestant homilies
there named. Among which I find the second is, "against
peril of idolatry." Now, the following, are the words of your
Protestant homily against idolatry. Its words are these: "The
preaching of God's word, most sincere in the beginning, by process
of time became less and less pure, and afterwards corrupt,
and last of all, altogether laid down and left off, &amp;c. Not only
the unlearned and simple, but the learned and wise; not the
people only, but the bishops; not the sheep, but also the shepherds
themselves, being blinded by the bewitchery of images, as
blind guides of the blind, fell both into the <i>pit of damnable
idolatry</i>; in which all the world, as it were drowned, continued
unto our age for the space of eight hundred years; unspoken
against in a manner, so that laity and clergy, learned and unlearned,
of all ages and sexes and degrees, of men and women and
children of whole Christendom, (an horrible thing to think,) have
been at once drowned in abominable idolatry, of all other vices
most detested by God, and damnable to men, and that for the
space of eight hundred years together. And to this end has
come that beginning of setting up of images in churches, then
judged harmless, in experience proved not only harmful, but
exitious and pestilential, and to the <i>destruction of all good
religion universally</i>." Thus far, your Protestant homily.</p>

<p>Really, most Reverend Gentlemen, if in my comments on the
above passage, I have often to use the word <i>damnable</i>, you must
really <i>pardon</i> me, for you see, I have just been taught this
<i>pretty</i> word, by your Scriptural Church, and you know, she is
master in Israel. Pray, most Reverend Gentlemen, where was
your Protestant Scriptural Church, during this <i>eight</i> hundred
years of damnable idolatry? If it was a member of <i>no</i> Church,
then, it was not a member, or part of <i>Christ's</i> Church. But if
it was a member, or part of any <i>one</i> Church in <i>all</i> Christendom,
then, it was utterly drowned in abominable, and damnable
idolatry. I wonder how your Scriptural Church, can extricate
herself out of this spiritual labyrinth.</p>

<p>Well, then, here we have, <i>according</i> to <i>your</i> Scriptural
Church, a universal apostacy. The true Church decayed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_24" id="Addr_2_Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
whole of Christendom drowned in damnable idolatry, and all
good religion destroyed <i>universally</i>, and <i>that</i>, for eight hundred
years; and we have also <i>your</i> Scriptural Church either not
existing, or buried in this universal spiritual destruction.
Really, your Scriptural Church, Sampson-like, not only
demolished the <i>whole</i> spiritual fabric of Christendom, but also
perished <i>herself</i> under the ruins of this universal spiritual
destruction; but the strangest thing of all is, whilst with <i>one</i>
hand, she was endeavouring with her spiritual power, to hurl the
Catholic Church, into the vortex of this universal spiritual
destruction, she, with <i>the other</i> hand, charitably saves <i>us</i>
Catholics (as Moses was saved from the waters) from this deluge
of universal spiritual idolatry; and I will now show you how;
for your Scriptural Church, in her sixth article of the Thirty-nine
Articles, teaches that, "Holy Scripture containeth all
things necessary to salvation." Now, this very Scripture, (the
book of salvation,) declares (as I have already shown in my
above description of the Catholic Church,) that, the Catholic
Church should <i>never</i> err, and of course, could <i>never</i> fall into
idolatry. And, therefore, in obedience to your Scriptural
Church, and to the Scripture itself, we believe that the Catholic
Church, <i>never</i> has fallen, and <i>never will</i> fall into idolatry. For
the Scripture says, "Heaven and earth <i>shall</i> pass away, but
God's word, <i>shall not</i> pass away." Really, your Scriptural
Church, is very kind to us in this respect, and I almost begin to
think, she must be a worthy descendant of Pharo's daughter,
who saved Moses from the waters of the Nile.</p>

<p>Well, Most Reverend Gentlemen, you see your scriptural
Church, has now hurled the whole of Christendom, into the
vortex of universal, abominable, and damnable idolatry, and
either involved herself, in this sweeping deluge of abominations,
or committed suicidical destruction on herself; but, <i>strange</i> to
say, she has <i>charitably</i> saved us benighted Papists, from these
abominable, and universal waters of idolatry, as Pharo's daughter,
kindly saved Moses from the waters of the Nile. Now, <i>how</i>
your scriptural Church as by law established will contrive to
gather together again, and unite all the various parts of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_25" id="Addr_2_Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
universal, spiritual edifice, just destroyed by her hands, I am at
a loss to determine. If <i>she really can</i> collect, unite, and form
these various spiritual parts, into a <i>more</i> perfect, and durable
edifice, than <i>God Himself</i> had made it, I shall <i>then</i> begin to
think, that she is invested with powers, which <i>even God Himself</i>
does not possess. But by <i>what</i> spiritual art of chemistry, is she
to perform this wonderful, and <i>superhuman</i> operation? If she
has recourse to <i>the Scriptures</i>, she will <i>there</i> learn, that God
had built this spiritual edifice on an <i>imperishable</i>, infallible,
and incorruptible foundation. And surely, for her sake, God
will not <i>contradict</i> Himself; and if she has recourse to her
thirty-nine articles, they have already annihilated her. O poor
scriptural Church! thou hast often made <i>sad</i> work with <i>other</i>
Churches; but <i>at last</i>, alas! thou art in <i>sad</i> straits thyself.
O! how thou remindest me of the man, who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Halting on crutches of unequal size,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One leg by truth supported, one by lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus saddled to the goal, with awkward pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure of nothing but to lose the race."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Well, but you will say, this immense spiritual edifice <i>must</i>
for the sake of the <i>salvation</i> of mankind, be <i>re</i>-built. Should I
offer <i>my officious</i> services, to assist in this pious work of reconstruction,
your scriptural Church might perhaps say, I destroyed
<i>more</i> than I built. Well, she could not, even then, justly
complain of this; for <i>she</i> has <i>just</i> cut into pieces, demolished,
and annihilated the <i>whole</i> of Christendom, with her destructive
weapons of universal, abominable, and damnable idolatry.</p>

<p>In all <i>material</i> edifices, it is considered of the greatest importance
that the <i>foundation</i> should be <i>firm</i>, <i>safe</i>, and substantial.
Of course, we have reason to expect <i>these</i> requisites in the foundation
of all <i>spiritual</i> edifices; and of course, we may <i>naturally</i>
expect them, in the new erection of God's work which your
Church has just destroyed, but which she is <i>now</i> going to re-construct
into a <i>more</i> perfect and durable form than <i>God</i> had made
it. Now, upon <i>what</i> foundation will your Church <i>re</i>construct
this demolished spiritual edifice? In her twenty-first article of
her thirty-nine articles, (and mind, she has sworn to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_26" id="Addr_2_Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
articles as God's truth,) I find the following words: "General
councils may not be gathered together without the commandment,
and will of princes. And when they be gathered together,
(forasmuch as they be an assembly of men, whereof all be not
governed by the Spirit, and word of God,) they <i>may err</i>, and
<i>sometimes have erred, even in things pertaining unto God</i>."</p>

<p>Now, please tell me, Most Reverend Gentlemen, of <i>what</i> is
your new spiritual Church to be built? Surely not of brick and
mortar! but of course, it is to be erected, on the testimony of
man, or of some body of men. But your article says, men may
err, and <i>have</i> erred, <i>even in things pertaining to God</i>. Therefore,
your council, or councils, of your new Church <i>may err</i>, and
therefore, how will you build upon these <i>fallible</i> men an <i>infallible</i>
foundation?</p>

<p>But you will indignantly reply, the article intimates, that they
may err <i>unless</i> governed by the <i>Spirit</i>, and word of God. Well,
Most Reverend Gentlemen, is it likely God will give <i>them</i> his
Spirit, and unerring word to <i>re</i>construct a new Church, when
they have just destroyed the infallible, and beautiful work of
<i>God's own hands</i>? Is it in the nature of things, that <i>God</i>
should <i>contradict</i> Himself, to second the BABEL ideas, of your
scriptural Church, yet to be formed?</p>

<p>Really, Sir, some of you Reverends will exclaim, <i>how</i> you are
<i>garbling</i> that twenty-first article! Why have you <i>slyly</i> omitted
to quote the <i>last</i> part of that article?&mdash;Well, as you have called,
for the <i>last</i> part of this article, I will now quote it; and as your
Church (<i>first</i>, indeed, unfortunately destroying herself) has just
so charitably saved us, benighted papists, from the waters of
idolatry, I do sincerely hope this <i>last</i> part of your article, may
enable you, to <i>re</i>build a godly and spiritual edifice. Well, then,
now for the <i>last</i> part of this twenty-first article, which you say, I
have <i>slyly omitted</i>. It runs thus verbatim: "Wherefore, things
ordained by them, as necessary to salvation, have neither
strength nor authority, unless it may be declared, that they be
taken out of Holy Scripture." Now, Most Reverend Gentlemen,
as you have just asked <i>me</i> a question, allow <i>me</i> to ask <i>you
another</i>. If any of you, were wishful to purchase an estate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_27" id="Addr_2_Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
would you not <i>first</i>, have the title deeds of that estate, <i>carefully</i>
examined by some eminent and respectable lawyers, <i>to be sure</i>
that the title deeds, were perfectly good, and satisfactory, <i>before</i>
you advanced the money? Now we have just learnt, from the
<i>last</i> part of your twenty-first article, that the Scriptures, properly
speaking, are the deeds of a <i>Christian</i>, by which he is to
obtain a <i>good</i> title to salvation. Of course, therefore, we may
<i>naturally</i> suppose, that your scriptural Church would hand down
to her followers the Scriptures, in the <i>most perfect</i> and <i>unmutilated</i>
state.</p>

<p>Well, we will now see whether she <i>has</i> done <i>this</i>, and <i>then</i> we
shall be able to determine, if she can <i>re</i>build her godly, and
spiritual edifice on so heavenly a foundation. We will now consider
how she got the sacred Scriptures, after her shipwreck amid
the perils of idolatry, and whether, <i>after</i> she got them, she handed
them down to her followers in the perfect and unmutilated state,
in which she <i>first</i> received them from the <i>Catholic Church</i>. Luther,
the father of the Reformation, even after he had left the Catholic
Church, candidly says, in his Commentary on the 16th chapter
of St. John's Gospel: "We are obliged to yield many things to
the Papists, that with them is the word of God, which <i>we</i>
received from <i>them</i>, otherwise we should have known <i>nothing at
all about it</i>." And, in his book against the Anabaptists, he
makes the following confession: "Under Papacy are many
good things, yea, <i>everything</i> that is <i>good</i> in <i>Christianity</i>. I say
moreover," continues he, "under Papacy is <i>true</i> Christianity,
even the <i>very kernel</i> of Christianity." From these two passages
of Luther, it is evident, that your scriptural Church, <i>first</i> received
the Scriptures from the <i>hand</i> of the <i>Catholic</i> Church, and that
she received them, in a <i>perfect</i> and <i>unmutilated</i> state; otherwise,
how could Luther's words be true, (and <i>mind</i>, he uttered these
words <i>after</i> he had left the Catholic Church) when he assures us,
that under Papacy is "true Christianity, yea, everything that is
good in Christianity, nay, the <i>very kernel</i> of Christianity."</p>

<p>Now let us see <i>how</i> your scriptural Church, corrupted and
mutilated the sacred volumes which she had received from
the Catholic Church in a <i>perfect</i> and <i>unmutilated</i> state.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_28" id="Addr_2_Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Luther was the first, after the Reformation, who put out a
Protestant translation of the Scriptures, which was <i>immediately</i>
condemned by Osiander, Rickerman, and Zuinglius. Of this
translation of Luther, Zuinglius says, (Lib. de Sacra.) "Luther
was a foul corrupter, and horrible falsifier of God's word. One,
who followed the Marcionites and Arians, that razed out such
places of Holy Writ, as were against him. Thou dost," says he
to Luther, "corrupt the word of God. Thou art seen to be a
manifest, and common corrupter, and perverter of the holy Scriptures.
How much are we ashamed of thee, who have hitherto
esteemed thee!" But Luther not only falsified, but he also
added, to the texts of the Scripture. "I know well," says
Luther, "that this word, alone, (which he added to St. Paul's
words, Rom. iii.) is not found in the text of St. Paul, but should
a Papist, annoy you upon it, tell him at once, without hesitation,
that Dr. Martin Luther, would have it so, and that a papist, and
an ass, are synonymous." (Tom. 5, Jena Edit. p. 141, 144.)</p>

<p>But Luther, soon had an opportunity of retaliating, on his disciple
Zuinglius. When Proscheverus, the Zuinglian printer of
Zurich, sent him a copy of the Zuinglian translation, Luther rejected
it, and sent it back to him, calling at the same time the
Zuinglian divines, in matters of divinity, "fools, asses, anti-christs,
deceivers, and of an ass-like understanding." (See
Zuing. tom. 2, ad Luth. Lib. de Sacr. fol. 338.)</p>

<p>Of the translation set forth by &OElig;colampadius, Beza says, that
it "is in many places wicked, and altogether differing from the
mind of the Holy Ghost." And he also condemns that of Castalio,
as being sacrilegious, wicked, and heathenish. (In Respons.
ad Defens. and Respons. Castal.)</p>

<p>We should naturally expect that Beza, after thus reproving
the translations of &OElig;colampadius and of Castalio, would <i>himself</i>
have produced an immaculate one; but the learned Molineus
observes of his translation, that "he (Beza) actually changes the
text, of which Molineus gives several instances." (In sua Translat.
Nov. Testi. part 20.)</p>

<p>Castalio wrote a whole book against Beza's corruptions of the
Scriptures, and yet, he adds, "I will not note all his (Beza's)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_29" id="Addr_2_Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
corruptions, for that would require too large a volume." (In
Defens. Transl.)</p>

<p>Of Calvin's translation the learned Molinus thus speaks:
"Calvin, in his harmony, makes the text of the Gospel to leap
up and down. He uses violence to the letter of the Gospel; and
besides this, adds to the text." (In sua Translat. Nov. Test.
part 12.)</p>

<p>Here, then, you have Zuinglius and others against Luther's
translation, and Luther against Zuinglius's translation, Beza
against &OElig;colampadius and Castilio's translation, and Castilio
against Beza's translation, and Molinus against Calvin's translation.
Now, which of all these false translations was your
scriptural Church to adopt as her only rule of faith and for that
of the people? Why, you Reverends will reply, she was to
adopt her <i>own</i> English translations.</p>

<p>Well, then we had better examine, and see whether they were
any better than <i>any</i> of the above translations, Carlile, in his
treatise on Christ's descent into hell, says of the English translators,
that they have "depraved the sense, obscured the sense,
obscured the truth, and deceived the ignorant; that in <i>many</i>
places, they do detort the scriptures from the <i>right</i> sense, and
that they show themselves to love darkness more than light,
falsehood more than truth." And in an abridgment which the
ministers of the diocese of Lincoln delivered to King James, they
denominated the English translation, "A translation that taketh
away from the text, that addeth to the text, and that sometime
to the changing, or obscuring of the meaning of the Holy Ghost;
a translation which is absurd and senseless, perverting, in many
places, the meaning of the Holy Ghost." Burges, in his Apology,
sec. 6, exclaims, "How shall I approve under my hand a translation,
which hath so many omissions, many additions, which
sometimes obscures, sometimes perverts the sense, being sometimes
senseless, sometimes contrary?" And Broughton, in his
letter to the Lords of the Council, gives this reason for requiring
a new translation without delay, that "That which is now in
England is full of errors." And, in his Advertisement of Corruptions,
he tells the bishops, "That their public translations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_30" id="Addr_2_Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Scriptures into English is such, as that it perverts the texts of
the Old Testament, in eight hundred and forty-eight places;
and that it causes millions of millions to reject the New Testament,
and to run to eternal flames."</p>

<p>But some of you Reverends may reply, those were the Protestant
translations of <i>earlier</i> times; but we have got <i>better</i>
translations now. Well, then we must now examine the truth
of your assertion. In November, 1822, the Irish Protestant
Society passed the following condemnatory resolution of the
Irish translators: "Resolved, that, after a full enquiry, the
members of this society feel satisfied, that material and very
numerous errors, exist in the version of the New Testament,
edited by the British and Foreign Bible Society." According
to Mr. Platt, thirty-five variations were discovered in the first
ten pages, of which seven were considered to be material.
"This proportion in a Testament of four hundred pages," says
the Hon. and Rev. Mr. Percival, "gives fourteen hundred
variations, and two hundred and eighty material errors in a
single volume." We find in the Monthly London Review, page
220, "That in April, 1832, a memorial was addressed on the
subject, to the vice-chancellors of the Universities of Cambridge
and of Oxford, and the other delegates of the Clarendon press."
It was signed by the following gentlemen:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>T. Bennet, D.D.</li>
<li>T. Blackburn.</li>
<li>George Collinson.</li>
<li>F. A. Cox, L.L.D.</li>
<li>Thomas Curtis.</li>
<li>T. Fletcher, D.D.</li>
<li>E. Henderson.</li>
<li>J. P. Smith, D.D.</li>
<li>T. Townley, D.D.</li>
<li>R. Winter, D.D.</li>
</ul>

<p>The names, attached to this memorial, are too respectable not
to communicate a great degree of importance, to any statement
to which they are affixed. This memorial states, "That the
modern Bibles, issued from the press of the University of Oxford,
abounded with deviations from the authorized version of King
James the First. That, though some of these errors were merely
typographical, yet of those that were intentional, the number was
of a serious amount. That in the Book of Genesis, there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_31" id="Addr_2_Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
upwards of eight hundred errors; in the Psalms, six hundred;
in the Gospel of St. Matthew, four hundred and sixteen; and in
about the fourth part of the Bible, an aggregate of two thousand,
nine hundred and thirty-one."</p>

<p>The same Monthly London Review, for February, 1833, speaking
of the pamphlet of Thomas Curtis, of Grove House, Islington,
on his discoveries of the falsification of the Bible, says: "In this
comparatively brief pamphlet, we find the exposition of one of
the most singular deceptions, to which the world has yet been
exposed. The imposition, is nothing short of a downright falsification
of the text of Scripture. Need we add a syllable more, to
rouse the attention of the thinking community?" In the same
pamphlet Mr. Curtis remarks: "About twenty years ago, an
intelligent reader at one of the printing offices, where the Bible
was in a course of printing, took the trouble of drawing up a
specification of a number of gross errors, which he found in the
very copy, <i>that had been selected by the proper authorities</i>, as the
<i>standard</i> of correctness to which he was to adhere. The errors
pointed out by the penetrating reader, amounted to no less, than
seven hundred and thirty-one, and these occurred in the various
chapters, from the beginning of Genesis, to the end of Jeremiah."</p>

<p>Well, most Reverend Gentlemen, it is plain from what I have
stated (and where is the person who can contradict what I have
stated), that the <i>first</i> Protestant foreign Reformers, corrupted and
falsified the sacred Scriptures, that your English Protestant
Reformers, did also the same, and that even at the present day,
your English Protestant translations of that sacred volume, are
in a most awful and corrupt state. And would to heaven I could
stop here!</p>

<p>But what will the English people say, when they learn, that
your Protestant scriptural Church, has <i>not only</i> falsified and
corrupted the Scriptures, but that she has had the audacity, to
expunge from the canon of the Scripture many books, which are
<i>as much canonical</i> (that is, as much the inspired word of God)
as those, which she still retains in her present Protestant canon.
I will now prove this. The Protestant Church, received at first
(as Luther truly informs us) the Scriptures from the Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_32" id="Addr_2_Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Church. The Catholic Church, therefore, must be good authority
in this respect, otherwise how can the Protestant Church
be, sure that her first Scriptures, were the real word of God?
Now, the Catholic Church has ranked, for at least fourteen
hundred years, many books as <i>canonical</i>, which <i>your</i> Protestant
Church rejects as <i>uncanonical</i>. In the year 397, a Catholic
council was held at Carthage, at which the learned and pious
St. Augustine assisted. In that council, the canon of the Scripture,
was satisfactorily determined; and in that very council,
many books were declared to be <i>canonical</i> (that is, the inspired
word of God,) which your Church, has had the audacity to tell
the people, are <i>not canonical</i>, that is, they are not to be considered
the inspired word of God. But <i>what</i> reason had your
scriptural Church, to assume the audacious power, to condemn as
<i>uncanonical</i>, books, which were declared by this illustrious,
numerous, and learned body of Christians, <i>to be canonical</i>, (that
is, the inspired word of God?) I ask you, <i>what</i> reason had your
scriptural Church for this <i>audacious</i> step? I answer, none. O
but I fancy I hear some of your reverends exclaiming, You are
wrong <i>for once</i>, old papish botheration. Look at the passage
in the sixth of our articles, between <i>our canonical</i> and <i>un</i>canonical
books, and there you will find a good reason for your
<i>popish</i> question.</p>

<p>Thank you, courteous clerks; I will now quote the passage,
and give <i>your</i> scriptural Church the benefit of it. "And the
other books (as Hierome saith) the Church doth read, for example
of life, and instruction of manners, but yet doth it not apply
them to establish any doctrine." (Art. 6, Ch. Eng. P. Book.)
Well, most Reverend Gentlemen, <i>truth</i> and <i>falsehood</i> are in this
passage, mixed up together <i>to a nicety</i>. In the first part, your
scriptural Church tells the people that she, like Hierom (and
mind, St. Hierom was a great Catholic Saint), reads her <i>un</i>canonical
books, for example of life and instruction of manners.
Well, <i>her object</i> for reading these books, as far as it goes, is
very good; but then, your scriptural Church <i>slyly</i> adds, "but
yet doth it not apply them <i>to establish</i> any doctrine:" an artful
inuendo that St. Hierom did the same. Now St. Hierom wished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_33" id="Addr_2_Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
indeed, the Catholic Church to read these books, for example of
life, and instruction of manners; but St. Hierom, at the same
time, included in the Catholic canon <i>all</i> the books, which had
been ranked in the Catholic canon by antiquity. Now, if your
scriptural Church, quoted St. Hierom's authority in confirmation
of the <i>first</i> part of this passage, why does she slyly intimate, to
follow him in the <i>second</i> part, where she contradicts St. Hierom,
by asserting that certain books of the Scripture, are <i>uncanonical</i>,
which St. Hierom believed, and taught were <i>really canonical</i>?
Come, Reverend Gentlemen, your Church <i>must</i> have had some
<i>sly</i> reason, for this <i>contradictory</i> conduct. Now, <i>do</i> tell us <i>what
this</i> reason was. Well, if <i>you</i> will not tell, <i>I</i> must.</p>

<p>You have seen, how the first reformers <i>falsified</i> the Scriptures,
to make the sacred text, harmonize with their <i>reformed</i> ideas;
but <i>what puzzled</i> them <i>most</i> was, they found there were certain
books, which they could not <i>possibly tune</i> to <i>their new</i> ideas.
They <i>durst</i> not indeed, <i>entirely</i> reject these sacred books; for
they knew in <i>what</i> veneration, they had been <i>always</i> held by
<i>antiquity</i>; but on the <i>other</i> hand, they <i>durst</i> not admit them as
<i>canonical</i>; for <i>then</i>, the <i>testimony</i> of <i>these</i> books, would upset
<i>their new-fangled</i> ideas; they thought, therefore, the <i>most convenient</i>
method, was to make <i>flesh</i> and <i>fish</i> of them, and <i>then</i>,
they could either <i>admit</i>, or <i>contradict</i> them, according to their
<i>own spiritual convenience</i>.</p>

<p>And that I am speaking the truth, I will give you <i>one single</i>
instance, and from this <i>one</i>, you will be able to judge of <i>the rest</i>,
of their sly method, of squaring the scripture to their <i>new</i>, and
<i>re</i>forming ideas. Of all the tenets of the Catholic creed, there is
<i>none</i>, that has been <i>more lustily</i> inveighed against, and accordingly,
<i>none</i> that sound <i>so awfully</i>, to an <i>English Protestant</i> ear,
as Purgatory, and Prayers for the dead. (<i>O keep your seats,
Most Reverend Gentlemen, I am not going to put you into Purgatory,
although you may imagine it smells very strongly of it
on this side the grave.</i>)<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> Well, mind this doctrine of Purgatory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_34" id="Addr_2_Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and of Prayers for the dead, was the belief of the Jews, and of
all the first Christians, and continued even to the time of the
Reformation. Now in the book of <i>Machabees</i>, this doctrine is so
<i>plainly</i> laid down, that no man in his senses, can contradict it.
Read the following passage, and tell me, if I am not speaking
the truth. "And making a gathering, he (Judas Machabeus)
sent 1200 drachms of silver to Jerusalem for sacrifice, to be
offered for the sins of the dead, thinking well, and religiously,
concerning their resurrection. (For if he had not hoped that
they that were slain, should rise again, it would have seemed
superfluous, and vain to pray for the dead.) And, because, he
considered that they who had fallen asleep with godliness, had
great grace laid up for them. It is, therefore, a holy and
wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed
from sins." II. Mac. xii. 43-46.</p>

<p>Now this passage was so <i>clear</i>, and <i>positive</i> a proof of purgatory,
and of prayers for the dead, that the first Reformers found, that
they could not get rid of it, <i>without denying the divine</i> authority
of the book. <i>Accordingly</i>, these new soul-menders, told the people
that the two Books of Machabees, were not included in the Jewish
Canon, but <i>unfortunately</i>, they <i>forgot</i> to tell the world <i>the
reason</i>, (viz.,) because the Jewish Canon was compiled by Esdras,
<i>long before</i> the Books of Machabees were written. And now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_35" id="Addr_2_Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
you may understand the <i>sly</i> words of your sixth article, "but
yet it doth not apply them (these books) to <i>establish any doctrine</i>,"
viz., to establish the <i>Catholic</i> doctrine, and to <i>overturn
their new-fangled</i> ideas.</p>

<p>Now, Gentlemen, is it not plain that your <i>Church</i>, hath <i>both
corrupted</i> the Scriptures, and expunged from her <i>Protestant</i>
Canon, many of the <i>inspired</i> books of those sacred volumes?</p>

<p>And now, allow me to quote the <i>first</i> part of the sixth Article
of your Church, and then, tell me <i>what</i> the <i>people</i> are to do, to
save their souls, and how your Scriptural Church, <i>is ever</i> to be
raised again, to a new spiritual life. "Holy Scripture containeth
all things necessary to salvation: so that, whatsoever is
not read therein, nor may be approved thereby, is not to be
required of any man, that it should be believed as an Article of
the Faith, or to be thought requisite or necessary to salvation.
In the name of the Holy Scripture, we do understand those
Canonical Books of the Old and New Testament, of whose
authority was never any doubt in the Church."</p>

<p>Now this part of your Article, assures us, in the strongest manner,
that the Holy Scriptures, contain all things necessary for salvation,
that they are the sure palladium of a Christian, and his
title-deeds to eternal life; and it also says, that in this sacred
volume, are to be included all the books of whose authority, was
never any doubt in the Church. Now, it is also plain from
what I have advanced, (and find me a person who can overturn
by <i>solid</i> argument what I have advanced,) it is plain, I repeat it,
that your Church has <i>both</i> falsified the text of the Scripture,
and expunged from her <i>Protestant</i> Canon, many books, whose
authority and divine inspiration, were held by antiquity in the
greatest veneration. Now, most Reverend Gentlemen, do tell
me what the people are to do. On the <i>one</i> hand, your Church tells
the people, there <i>is no</i> salvation <i>without</i> the Scripture: and on
the <i>other</i> hand, your Church has falsified the text, and also
expunged from her <i>Protestant</i> Canon, many <i>inspired</i> Books of
the Scripture. Really, can you obtain the possession of property
by <i>corrupt</i> and mutilated title-deeds? Certainly not. How,
<i>then</i>, are your people to obtain eternal life by your <i>false</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_36" id="Addr_2_Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
mutilated title-deeds of the Scripture? Really, most Reverend
Gentlemen, if the prejudices of my popish education do not
strongly deceive me, your Protestant mutilation of the Scripture,
and your Sixth Article, are pregnant with the most <i>paradoxical</i>
consequences. O how justly may I apply to <i>your</i> Scriptural
Church, the observations which a distinguished minister of the
Church <i>of England</i>, applied to the operations of the Bible
Society; these are his words: "Surely, it is enough to make a
Christian's blood run cold, to think of the sacrilegious presumption
of a Society, which dares thus to tamper, and trifle with the
revelation of the Almighty, and dares publish to the heathen,
and attempt to pawn upon its credulous supporters, these schoolboy
exercises of its agents, as the Sacred Word of God! It is
the circulation of such translations as these, that, more than
once, at the meetings of this Society, have been blasphemously
compared to the miraculous gift of tongues. And such a system
is supported, and such comparisons applauded by many, who, on
other occasions, lay claim, and justly, to the characters of piety
and intelligence."<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> O how justly might he have applied these
observations to his own Church.<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_37" id="Addr_2_Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p><p>We have now seen, most Reverend Gentlemen, the falsification,
and mutilation of the Sacred Scriptures, by the Protestant
Reformers. Your Sixth Article tells the people, that the Scriptures
are the only means of salvation; but of course, she must
mean <i>correct</i> copies, and <i>authenticated</i> translations of those sacred
volumes. Now, what are the people to do for eternal life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_38" id="Addr_2_Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
placed as they are, on the one hand, between your falsified, corrupt,
and mutilated Scriptures, and on the other hand, the absolute
necessity (according to your Sixth Article) of culling their
religion from the Scriptures? But, as there is no hope of salvation,
for the people in this awful fix, do you think, you could
raise a church for the people, instead of these falsified scriptures?
But then, it is evident, that you cannot raise that
church, on the frail foundation of these falsified, and mutilated
scriptures. Really I am sorry, that I declined the assistance of
the Spanish chemist, as he might, perhaps, have thrown some
new light, on this subject by his wonderful chemical operations.
O! but a very bright idea, has just popped into my mind, that
your Protestant prayer-book, was first made 'by the aid of the
Holy Ghost, and for the honour of God.' Surely, we shall now
succeed, by the aid of the Holy Ghost, and for the noble object
of God's honour. Well, then, we will now see, how this prayer-book,
was first made by men, 'aided by the Holy Ghost, and for
the honour of God;' we will then see, how these very men who at
first declare, that this prayer-book, which was made by the aid
of the Holy Ghost, and for the honour of God, afterwards most
solemnly swear, that all these inspirations of the Holy Ghost
were heretical, and contrary to true religion, and then, how they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_39" id="Addr_2_Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
bring back this prayer-book, and enact the most severe penalties
on all, who will not adopt its use.</p>

<p>In the reign of Henry the Eighth, the faith of Protestantism,
and defection from the Catholic faith, first partially began. In
the reign of his son, Edward VI., Protestantism, made a-head,
and Catholicism, rapidly declined. It was in the reign of this
youth Edward VI., (only eleven years of age,) that the Protestant
prayer-book, was made by Act of Parliament. In the preamble
of this Act (i. &amp; ii. Edward VI.) we are informed that Edward
(only eleven years of age) appointed the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and others, who, "aided by the Holy Ghost, and for the
honour of God," made this prayer-book. Take notice that this
Act (i. &amp; ii. Edward VI.) declares, that this Protestant prayer-book,
was made by these men, "aided by the Holy Ghost, and
for the honour of God." This Act of Parliament, provided also,
that if any clergyman, refused to use this prayer-book, in the
public service, he should, for the first offence, forfeit to the King
one year's income of his benefice, and be imprisoned for six
months; for the second, he should be deprived of the whole of
his benefice, and be imprisoned for one year; and for the third
offence, he should be imprisoned for his whole life. But this
Act, was not confined merely to the clergy, it extended also to
the laity. It enacted, that if any layman, should by interludes,
plays, songs, rhymes, or by other open words, declare, or speak
anything to the derogation of the said common prayer-book,
penalty after penalty, was to follow, until he had forfeited all
his goods, and chattels to the King, and to be imprisoned for
life. Such, was the first formation, of your Protestant prayer-book,
as the Act of Parliament, (i. &amp; ii. Edward VI.) plainly
shews.</p>

<p>Now, let us see the result, in the next reign. Edward died
seven years afterwards, and was succeeded by his sister, Mary,
who was a Catholic. Almost, as soon as Mary had ascended
the throne, the very men repeal the whole of the famous Act,
for making the common prayer-book, and that too, on the
grounds that this prayer-book, was contrary to true religion,
although, in the former reign, they had solemnly declared, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_40" id="Addr_2_Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
had been assisted, "by the Holy Ghost" in the making of this
prayer-book; they also abolished all the pains, and penalties,
which they had enacted, in the former reign, against the clergy,
and laity, for not using this common prayer-book, and this too,
on the express ground, that they had been for years, wandering
in error, and schism, although, they had had the barefacedness to
assert, in the previous reign, that the Holy Ghost, had assisted
them in the formation of this common prayer-book.</p>

<p>Well, Mary died about five years afterwards, and was succeeded
by her sister Elizabeth, who was at first a Catholic, but
shortly turned Protestant. Now the second Act of this Queen,
(i. Eliz. chap. 2.) brought back again, this prayer-book. In
Mary's reign these very men, had abolished this very prayer-book,
as schismatical, they now recall this common prayer-book,
and inflict the most severe penalties, upon all, who will not use
it, in the public service. For the first offence, it was now
enacted, the clergy were to forfeit a year's income, and be
imprisoned for a year; for the second offence, they were to forfeit
all their incomes, and be imprisoned for life, for refusing to
use this common prayer-book, in the public service. The people
also, were compelled on Sundays, and holydays, to attend the
Church, and to use this common prayer-book, under various
penalties, and in failure of paying these penalties, they were to
be imprisoned. Bishops, Archdeacons, and other Ordinaries,
were to have power, to inflict these punishments. Really the
conduct of these men, is, so inconsistent and monstrous, that if
we had not Acts of Parliament for it, I should have been afraid
to state it, upon any other authority. In the reign of Edward,
these very men make the common prayer-book, and declare it a
work of the Holy Ghost, and for the honour of God; then, in
about seven years afterwards, in the reign of Mary, they declare
this book to be schismatical, and contrary to true religion,
although in the former reign, they had asserted, it was a work
of the Holy Ghost, and for the honour of God; and then in
about five years afterwards, these very men recant again, recall
this prayer-book, and inflict the most severe pains, and penalties,
both on clergy and laity, who refuse the use of it. Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_41" id="Addr_2_Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Reverend Gentlemen, may I ask you, what kind of a prayer-book,
must that be, which was made by these inconsistent, and
monstrous men? and yet, such is your Protestant prayer-book, of
the Church of England as by Law established.</p>

<p>But some of you reverends, will perhaps reply, really, Sir, it
is too bad of you, thus to lower our Protestant Prayer-book, for
we Protestants all know, how many beautiful, and admirable
parts there are in that Church Prayer-book. Most Reverend
Gentlemen, before I answer this objection, we must quietly trace
back our steps to the Spanish chemist. Of course, I have forbidden
myself the application of his wonderful, chemical operations
to your Church. But then, you yourselves can apply
them, and judge whether there really is, any analogy or not,
between his chemical operations, and the spiritual works of your
scriptural Church. Well, then, I have shewn you, what a beautiful
Church God and Jesus Christ first built; and I have shown
you the sure, and infallible foundation of that Church, which
was to be perpetuated from age to age, with the world for its boundaries,
and time for its duration. I have shewn you, how, in
the sixteenth century, arose a body of men, the most audacious,
and strange spiritual chemists, that the world ever beheld,
whether you consider the spiritual instructor of some of them, or
whether you consider the strange doctrines they advanced, and the
barefaced manner, in which they defended, and propagated their
new-fangled ideas. I have shewn you, how these strange spiritual
chemists, wished to demolish God's infallible Church, how
they cut it into pieces of universal and damnable idolatry, how
then, they put these various parts into the sublimatory glass of
falsification, and mutilation of God's word. You then saw, how
these spiritual chemists, and their followers, have been trying in
vain, for these three hundred years at least, to collect, and unite,
and form these various parts of Christ's Church (which according
to their bare assertion, had fallen into error), into a more
perfect, and durable form, than that which God had first given
it. You have seen, how these Protestant children of the Reformation,
honoured England with a Protestant Prayer-book,
the formation of which, almost defies all the power of credibility;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_42" id="Addr_2_Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and were there not Acts of Parliament to show this, it would be
an insult to any Englishman, to assert such a thing in his
presence. Now with all these facts before you, is there not a
great analogy, between the outrageous conduct of your Church,
and that of the Spanish chemist, who destroyed his master, with
the design of raising him, to a more perfect and durable state,
than that which God had first given him?</p>

<p>I ask you, most Reverend Gentlemen, with all these awful and
incontestible facts before you, will your Protestant Church, ever
be able to raise Christ's Church, to as perfect and as durable a
state, as she <i>is now</i>, and <i>was then</i>, when you withdrew from her?
Your Protestant Church has been trying her hand, at this work
of reformation, for more than three hundred years, and still she
is something like the Irishman's wife: Pat got married, and in
about three months after, went to the priest, and said, "Plaise
your reverince, you didn't marry me and my wife rightly."
"Well," asked the clergyman, "how did I marry you wrongly?"
"Plaise your reverince, didn't you say, I was to take my wife
for better, and for worse?" "Certainly," replied the priest.
"Now, plaise your reverince, she's all worse, and no better."
Really, how justly may we apply this to your Church of England
as by law established. In short, this country, the wonder of the
world in commerce, in the arts and sciences, in the extent of her
navy, and the power of her army, this wonderful nation, presents,
in point of religion, a confused medley of every sort, and
of every form of worship, a perfect chaos of doctrines, in which
every one plunges, and tosses, dogmatizing as fancy or feeling
directs. In consequence of this confusion of religious opinions,
men know not, to whom to listen, what to believe, or what to do.
This confusion of religious opinions, and doctrines, commenced
with the Reformation, and has continued, and daily increased
ever since. O how justly did a chief of the savages, address,
near Boston, a missionary, who had gone with his Bible, to convert
the pagans of that country. "How," asked this chief, "can
<i>your</i> religion be the <i>true</i> one, since you <i>white</i> men do not <i>all</i>
profess the <i>same</i>? Agree among <i>yourselves</i> in this point, and <i>then</i>
we will attend to you." (Phil. Gaz. Nov. 1817.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_43" id="Addr_2_Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>But some of you reverends, will ask again: Really, sir, do
you pretend to assert, that our Common Prayer-book, and that
our Protestant Church, do not contain <i>any</i> spiritual treasures?
I answer, that in all counterfeit coin, which is well executed,
the gold is often laid on the base metal rather thickly, and with
great ingenuity. Now, this is the case with your counterfeit
prayer-book, and with your counterfeit religion. Whoever will
take the pains to examine carefully, the strange mixture of good,
and of evil, which is to be found in your Protestant Prayer-book,
and in your Protestant religion, will, at first, stand astonished,
but his astonishment will soon cease, when he finds that the
little good which is in them, flows from the Church of Jesus
Christ, which you formerly left, and that the evils with which
they abound, flow from the inventions and the ingenuity of man.</p>

<p>Allow me to give you a few instances of this. In the Apostles'
creed (and in your Thirty-nine Articles you admit this creed as
the word of God), you profess to believe, in the Holy Catholic
Church. Now, this is the real word of God, which your Church
admits; but then, you also solemnly declare, that you believe in
your hearts, and from your soul, that the doctrine of the Roman
Catholic Church is idolatrous. Now this is the mere human invention
of your Protestant Church. Now when these two doctrines,
the one from God, and the other from man, are brought
in contact, let us see what sad consequences they make with
you, and your scriptural Church. You profess to believe, in the
Catholic Church; but Catholic, means universal, and as the
Roman Catholics form the greatest body of Christians, their
Church only, can be the Catholic, or universal Church; for
Catholic, and universal, mean the <i>same</i> thing. But mind, you
destroy this Catholic or universal Church. How? Why you
swear, that her doctrine is idolatrous. How, then, can she be
holy? Thus, you see, by joining in religion the word of God,
with the inventions of man, you destroy (though perhaps without
intending it) the holy Catholic Church, in which you profess to
believe.</p>

<p>I will now give you another instance. At the end of the
Communion Service of your Common Prayer-book, I find these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_44" id="Addr_2_Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
words: "It is hereby declared, that thereby no adoration is
intended, or ought to be done, either unto the sacramental bread
or wine, there bodily received, or to any corporal presence of
Christ's natural flesh and blood. For the sacramental bread
and wine, remain still in their very natural substances, and
therefore, may not be adored, for that were idolatry, to be abhorred
of all faithful Christians." Of course, the plain meaning
of these words is, that Jesus Christ is not present in the Lord's
Supper, and therefore, it would be a great crime to there adore
him. But, what does your Church Catechism (which is in your
prayer-book) teach children on this subject? Why, it asks
them, "What is the inward part, or the thing signified?" Your
Church Catechism answers: "The Body and Blood of Christ,
which are <i>verily</i> and <i>indeed taken</i>, and <i>received</i> by the faithful, in
the <i>Lord's Supper</i>." Now this declares, that our Saviour, is
<i>really</i> present in the <i>Lord's Supper</i>, for how can you <i>really</i>, and
indeed <i>take</i> Him, and <i>receive</i> Him, if He is not <i>really</i> there? Thus,
in <i>one</i> part of your prayer-book, you solemnly declare, that our
Saviour is <i>not</i> present, in the <i>Lord's Supper</i>, and therefore it
would be idolatry there to adore him; but in <i>another</i> part of the
<i>same</i> prayer-book, you teach children that He is <i>present</i>; and that
they <i>verily</i> and <i>indeed take</i> Him and <i>receive</i> Him in the <i>Lord's
Supper</i>. The Act of Parliament of Edward VI., for the making
of this Common Prayer-book, declares it to be a work of the
Holy Ghost; but I hope you will excuse me for saying, that I
think it was a very curious Holy Ghost, and whether it was
black, or white, really I have not sufficient of the prophet in me
to divine. But how was this <i>manifest</i> contradiction, introduced
into your prayer-book? Why, I will tell you; the doctrine of
the <i>real</i> presence of our Saviour in the Blessed Sacrament, had
been believed by the great body of Christians, ever since the
time of our Saviour, until the Reformation. Luther and Zuinglius,
indeed, as you know, were convinced <i>by the devil</i>, that our
Saviour was <i>not</i> present in the Blessed Sacrament, and that,
therefore, it would be idolatry to believe it; but then, how were
they to manage to substitute their new-fangled opinions, for the
constant belief of all former christian ages? Why, they made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_45" id="Addr_2_Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
flesh and fish of them; they mixed together again the word of
God with the inventions of man, and then, thought that the
people's orthodox stomachs, would <i>swallow better</i> their new-fangled
religious ideas.</p>

<p>But, what has often amused me the most, in your scriptural
Church, is this; you solemnly declare, that the doctrine of
Catholics, is idolatrous; but, should any of these poor Catholic
sinners, condescend to lay their idolatrous bones, in any of your
churchyards; what do you <i>then</i> declare? Why, that you commit
to the dust, this Catholic, (who according to you during life
has been a most idolatrous sinner,) "in the sure, and certain
hope of resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus
Christ;" for you would thus pray: "O merciful God, we meekly
beseech Thee, that when we shall depart this life, we may rest
in Him (Christ) as our hope is, this our brother doth." Thus
you tell us, that during life, we Catholics live in the horrible sin
of idolatry, and then, after death, you are willing to commit us,
<i>for a comfortable fee</i>, "to the dust, in the sure, and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus
Christ."</p>

<p>Again, you often warn the people, against the idolatrous practice
of praying to the Saints, and assure the people, there is
<i>only one</i> mediator, our Lord Jesus Christ. And yet, on Sundays,
you have no difficulty, in recommending the sick, to the prayers
of the faithful. But, why should <i>you</i> do <i>this</i>, when according <i>to
you</i>, there is <i>only one</i> mediator, our Lord Jesus Christ? If <i>you</i>
can thus ask the prayers of the faithful, without injuring the
mediation of our Saviour; why cannot the <i>Catholic</i>, ask the
prayers of the Saints, without injuring the mediation of Jesus
Christ? O! but you will say, the Saints, and Angels cannot
hear our prayers. Well but does not the Scripture tell us, "that
the devil goes about, like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may
devour," and does not our Saviour say, "there is more joy in
heaven, over one sinner doing penance, than over ninety-nine
just?" It appears, therefore, the devils know, and hear what
is passing upon earth, and why should not the saints and
angels of God? Nay, it is evident, they <i>must</i> know and hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_46" id="Addr_2_Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
things, which are passing upon earth, otherwise how could they
rejoice <i>in heaven</i>, on the conversion of sinners <i>on earth</i>?</p>

<p>But, as you boast so much of the admirable, spiritual treasures
of your prayer-book, and of your scriptural Church, just
tell me, most Reverend Gentlemen, why they have never yet,
been able to produce a single saint? The Scripture, tells us,
that a tree, may be known from <i>its fruit</i>. And yet, among all
the rich spiritual treasures, of your prayer-book, and of your
scriptural Church, for these three hundred years, you have
<i>never</i> yet produced a person, who, on account of his virtue and
piety, has been honoured by posterity with the name of <i>saint</i>.
Nay, so great is your poverty in <i>this respect</i>, that your Church,
has been obliged to <i>steal Catholic</i> Saints, and barefacedly insert
<i>them</i>, in your <i>Protestant</i> calendar. Really most Reverend Gentlemen,
your scriptural Church, is of a very strange texture. I
have shewn you above, how remarkable she has always been for
forgery; I have also shewn you, how she unjustly robbed the
poor of their just rights, and how, she has endeavoured, by all
means possible, to rob us of the honourable name of Catholic;
and how, she has stolen many of our great Catholic Saints, and
presumptuously inserted <i>them</i> in her <i>Protestant</i> calendar. Really,
Gentlemen, may I not exclaim with the poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Can such things be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And overcome us like a summer's cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without our special wonder!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, Sir, if the Protestant prayer-book, and the Protestant
religion, be such a monstrous compound of inconsistencies and
errors, as you would fain lead us to suppose, pray tell us, why
England, was so foolish, as to renounce the Catholic, and embrace
the Protestant faith? The answer to this objection I would
most willingly waive, as it would lead me into a field of persecution,
and <i>cruelty</i>, over which my feelings would not wish to
travel. But as the answer to the above objection, has been so
ably given, by a <i>Protestant</i> member of Parliament, to a <i>Protestant</i>
Lord, I think I cannot do <i>better</i>, than give it in his own words.
And <i>mind</i>, when you read this letter, you must not imagine, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_47" id="Addr_2_Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
you are reading the <i>mere</i> opinions of <i>this</i> writer; no, the opinions
which he there states, are <i>incontestible facts</i>, which stand, almost
as large as life, in our English Statute-Book; and are there,
recorded so plainly, that no man in his senses, can have the presumption
to deny them. I beg leave, therefore, to lay before
you, the following letter, of a <i>Protestant</i> member of Parliament,
to a <i>Protestant</i> lord, on the present subject; and I am sure, that
the incontestible facts, <i>facts of our own English Statute-book</i>, there
stated, will convince you, how England once Catholic, was
brought over to Protestantism.</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">A LETTER TO LORD TENTERDEN,<br />
<span class="small">LORD CHIEF JUSTICE OF ENGLAND.</span></p>

<p class="ralign"><i>April 6th, 1829.</i></p>
<p class="smcap">"My Lord,</p>

<p>"I have read the report of your Lordship's speech, made on the 4th instant,
on the second reading of the Catholic Bill, and there is one passage of it on
which I think it my duty thus publicly to remark. The passage to which I
allude relates to the character of the <i>Law-established Church</i>, and also to the
probable fate that will, in consequence of this bill, attend her in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<p>"Now, with very sincere respect for your Lordship, I do think it my duty
to the people of this country, to show that the character which you have
given to the Church of England as by <i>law</i> established, is not correct; to show
that she is not, and never has been, <i>tolerant in matters of religion</i>; and is not,
and never has been, <i>favourable to civil liberty</i>. In short, with most sincere
respect for your Lordship, with greater respect for you than I have ever had
for any public functionary in England, and with the greatest admiration of
your conduct in your high and important office, with all these, I think it my
duty <i>flatly to contradict</i> your Lordship with regard to the character of this
Church, and especially in the two particulars mentioned by you. I do not
charge you with insincerity: for why should you not be in error as to this
matter, when I know that <i>twenty or thirty years ago</i> I myself should, in a
similar case, have said just what you have now said on this subject? Nevertheless,
it being error, and gross error too, and I <i>knowing it to be error</i>, I am
bound, in duty to my readers, to expose the error; and I am the more strictly
bound, because this error coming from you, is the more likely to be widely
spread.</p>

<p>"First, then, my Lord, let us take your proposition, 'that there is no
Church so tolerant as this.' I am sure your Lordship has never read her
history; I am sure you have not; if you had, you never would have uttered
these words. Not being content to deal in general terms, I will <i>not</i> say that
she has been, and was from her outset, the most intolerant Church that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_48" id="Addr_2_Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
world ever saw; that she started at first, armed with halters, ripping-knives,
axes, and racks; that her footsteps were marked with the blood, while her
back bent under the plunder of her innumerable innocent victims; and that
for refinement in cruelty, and extent of rapacity, she never had an equal,
whether corporate or sole. I will not thus speak of her in general terms, but
will lay before your Lordship some historical <i>facts</i>, to make good that <i>contradiction</i>
which I have given to your words. I assert that this <span class="smcap">Law-Church</span> is
the most <span class="small">INTOLERANT</span> Church I ever read or heard of; and this assertion I now
proceed to make good.</p>

<p>"This Church began to <i>exist</i> in 1547, and in the reign of Edward VI. Until
now the religion of the country had been for several years under the tyrant
Henry VIII. a sort of mongrel; but now it became wholly Protestant by
<span class="small">LAW</span>. The Articles of Religion and the Common Prayer-book were now
drawn up, and were established by Acts of Parliament. The Catholic altars
were pulled down in all the Churches; the priests, on pain of ouster and fine,
were compelled to teach the new religion, that is to say, to be apostates; and
the people who had been born and bred Catholics were not only punished if
they heard mass, but were also punished if they did not go to hear the new
parsons; that is to say, if they refused to become apostates. The people,
smarting under this tyranny, rose in insurrection in several parts, and, indeed,
all over the country. They complained that they had been robbed of their
religion, and of the relief to the poor which the old Church gave; and they
demanded that the mass and the monasteries should be restored, and that the
priests should not be allowed to marry. And how were they answered? The
bullet and bayonet at the hand of German troops slaughtered a part, caused
another part to be hanged, another part to be imprisoned and flogged, and
the remainder to submit, outwardly at least, to the <span class="smcap">Law-Church</span>; (and now
mark this tolerant and merciful Church,) many of the old monastics and
priests, who had been expelled from their convents and livings, were compelled
to beg their bread about the country, and they thus found subsistence
among the pious Catholics. This was an eye-sore to the <span class="smcap">Law-Church</span>, who
deemed the very existence of these men who had refused to apostatize, a libel
on her. Therefore, in company, actually in company with the law that
founded the new Church, came forth a law to punish beggars, by burning
them in the face with a red-hot iron, and by making them slaves for two
years, with power in their masters to make them wear an iron collar. Your
Lordship must have read this Act of Parliament, passed in the first year of the
first Protestant reign, and coming forth in company with the Common Prayer-book.
This was tolerant work, to be sure; and fine proof we have here of
this Church being "favourable to civil and religious liberty." Not content
with stripping these faithful Catholic priests of their livings; not content with
turning them out upon the wide world, this tolerant Church must cause them
to perish with hunger, or to be branded slaves.</p>

<p>"Such was the tolerant spirit of this Church when she was young. As to
her burnings under Cranmer (who made the Prayer-book), they are hardly
worthy of particular notice, when we have before us the sweeping cruelties
of this first Protestant reign, during which, short as it was, the people of
England suffered so much that the suffering actually thinned their numbers;
it was a people partly destroyed, and that too in the space of about six years;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_49" id="Addr_2_Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and this is acknowledged even in Acts of Parliament of that day. But this
<span class="smcap">Law-church</span> was established in reality during the reign of Old Bess, which
lasted forty-five years; that is, from 1558 to 1603; and though this Church has
always kept up its character, even to the present day, its deeds during this
long reign are the most remarkable.</p>

<p>"Bess (the shorter the name the better), established what she called a <i>court of
high commission</i>, consisting chiefly of <i>bishops</i> of your Lordship's '<i>most tolerant</i>
Church,' in order to punish all who did not conform to her religious creed, she
being '<i>the head of the Church</i>.' This commission were empowered to have control
over the <i>opinions</i> of all men, and to punish all men according to their <i>discretion
short of death</i>. They had power to extort evidence by the <i>prison</i> or by the
rack. They had power to compel a man (<i>on oath</i>) to <i>reveal his thoughts</i>, and to
<i>accuse himself, his friend, brother, parent, wife, or child</i>; and this, too, on <i>pain
of death</i>. These monsters, in order to <i>discover priests</i>, and to crush the old
religion, <i>fined, imprisoned, racked</i>, and did such things as would have made
Nero shudder to think of. They sent hundreds to the <i>rack</i> in order to get
from them confessions, <i>on which confessions many of them were put to death</i>.</p>

<p>"I have not room to make even an enumeration of the deeds of religious
persecution of this long and bloody reign; but I will state a few of them.</p>

<p>"1. It was <i>death</i> to make a new Catholic priest within the kingdom.&mdash;2. It
was <i>death</i> for a Catholic priest to come into the kingdom from abroad.&mdash;3. It
was <i>death</i> to harbour a Catholic priest coming from abroad.&mdash;4. It was <i>death</i>
to confess to such a priest.&mdash;5. It was <i>death</i> for any priest to say mass. 6. It
was <i>death</i> for any one to hear mass. 7. It was <i>death</i> to <i>deny</i> or <i>not to swear</i>,
if called on, that this woman was the head of the Church of Christ.&mdash;8. It was
an offence (punishable by heavy fine) <i>not to go to the Protestant Church</i>. This
fine was 20 <i>a lunar month</i>, or 250 a-year, and of our present money, 3,250
a year. Thousands upon thousands refused to go to the Law-Church; and
thus the head of the Church sacked thousands upon thousands of estates!
The poor conscientious Catholics who refused to go to the 'most tolerant'
Church, and who had no money to pay fines, were crammed into the gaols,
until the counties petitioned to be relieved from the expense of keeping
them. They were then discharged, being first publicly whipped, and having
their ears bored with a red-hot iron. But this very great 'toleration' not
answering the purpose, an act was passed to banish for life all these non-goers
to Church, if they were not worth twenty pounds; and, in case of return, they
were to be punished with death.</p>

<p>"I am, my Lord, not making loose assertions here; I am all along stating
from Acts of Parliament, and the above form a small sample of the whole; and
this your Lordship must know well. I am not declaiming, but relating undeniable
facts; and with facts of the same character, with a <i>bare list</i>, made in the above
manner, I could fill a considerable volume. The names of the persons put to
death merely for <i>being Catholics</i>, during this long and bloody reign, would,
especially if it were to include Ireland, form a list ten times as long as that of
<i>our</i> army and navy, both taken together. The usual mode of inflicting death
was to hang the victim for a short time, just to benumb his or her faculties;
then cut down and instantly rip open the belly, and <i>tear out the heart</i>, and
hold it up, fling the bowels into a fire, then chop off the head, and cut the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_50" id="Addr_2_Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
body into quarters, then <i>boil</i> the head and quarters, and then hang them up
at the gates of cities, or other conspicuous places. This was done, including
Ireland, to many hundreds of persons, merely for adhering to the Church in
which they had been born and bred. There were <span class="small">ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-SEVEN</span>
<i>ripped up and boiled</i> in England in the years from 1577 to 1603; that is
to say, in the last twenty-six years of Bess's reign; and these might all have
been spared if they would have agreed to go to Church and <i>hear</i> the Common
Prayer! All, or nearly all, of them were racked before they were put to
death; and the cruelties in prison, and the manner of execution, were the
most horrible that can be conceived. They were flung into dungeons, and
kept in their filth, and fed on bullock's liver, boiled but unwashed tripe, and
such things as dogs are fed upon. Edward Genings, a priest, detected in saying
<i>mass</i> in Holborn, was after sentence of death offered his pardon if he
would go to Church, but having refused to do this, and having at the place of
execution boldly said, that he would die a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge
the Queen to be the spiritual <i>head</i> of the Church, Topliffe, the
attorney-general, ordered the rope to be cut the moment the victim was
turned off, 'so that' (says the historian) 'the priest, being little or nothing
stunned, stood on his feet, casting his eyes towards heaven, till the hangman
tripped up his heels, and flung him on the block, where he was ripped
up and quartered.' He was so much alive, even after the bowelling, that he
cried with a loud voice, 'Oh! it smarts!' And then he exclaimed, '<i>Sancte
Gregorie, ora pro me</i>:' while the hangman having sworn a most wicked oath,
cried, 'Zounds! his heart is in my hand, and yet Gregory is in his mouth!'</p>

<p>"The tolerance of the Law-Church was shown towards women as well as
towards men. There was a Mrs. Ward, who, for assisting a priest to escape
from prison (the crime of that priest being saying mass), was imprisoned,
flogged, racked, and finally hanged, ripped up, and quartered. She was executed
at Tyburn, on the 30th of August, 1588. At her trial the judges asked
if she had done the thing laid to her charge. She said 'Yes!' and that she
was happy to reflect that she had been the means of 'delivering that innocent
lamb from the hands of those bloody wolves.' They in vain endeavoured
to terrify her into a confession relative to the place whither the
priest was gone; and when they found threats unavailing, they promised her
pardon if she would go to Church; but she answered, that she would lose
many lives if she had them, rather than acknowledge the heretical Church.
They, therefore, treated her very savagely, ripped her up while in her senses,
and made a mockery of her naked quarters.</p>

<p>"There was a Mrs. Clithero pressed to death at York, in the year 1586.
She was a lady of good family, and her crime was relieving and harbouring
priests. She refused to plead, that she might not tell a lie, nor expose others
to danger. She was, therefore, pressed to death, in the following manner.
She was laid on the floor, on her back. Her hands and feet were bound
down as close as possible. Then a great door was laid upon her, and many
hundred weights placed upon that door. Sharp stones were put under her
back, and the weights pressing upon her body, first broke her ribs, and
finally, though by no means quickly, extinguished life. Before she was laid
on the floor, Fawcett, the sheriff, commanded her to be stripped naked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_51" id="Addr_2_Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
when she, with four women who accompanied her, requested him, on their
knees, for the honour of womanhood, that this might be dispensed with; but
he refused. Her husband was forced to flee the country; her little children
who wept for their dear and good mother, were taken up, and being questioned
concerning their religious belief, and answering as they had been
taught by her, were severely whipped, and the eldest, who was but twelve
years old, was cast into prison.</p>

<p>"Need I go on, my Lord? Twenty large volumes, allotting only one page
to each case, would not, if we were to include Ireland, contain an account of
those who have fallen victims to their refusal to conform to this 'most tolerant
Church in the world.' Nay, a hundred volumes, each volume being 500
pages, and one page allowed to each victim, would not suffice for the holding
of this bloody record. Short of death by ripping up, there were, <i>death</i> by
martial law, <i>death</i> in prison, and this in cases without number, banishment
and loss of estate. Doctor Bridgewater, in a table published by him at the
end of the <i>Concertatio Ecclesi Catholic</i>, gives the names of about twelve
hundred who had suffered in this way, before the year 1588; that is to say,
before the great heat of the 'tolerance.' In this list there are 21 bishops, 120
monastics, 13 deans, 14 archdeacons, 60 prebendaries, 530 priests, 49 doctors
of divinity, 18 doctors of law, 15 masters of colleges, 8 earls, 10 barons, 26
knights, 326 gentlemen, 60 ladies and gentlewomen. Many of all those, and,
indeed, the greater part of them, died in prison, and several of them died
while under sentence of death.</p>

<p>"There, my Lord, I do not think that you will question the truth of this
statement: and if you cannot, I hope you will allow, that no lover of truth
and justice ought to be silent while reports of speeches are circulating, calling
this 'the <i>most tolerant</i> Church in the world.' But, my Lord, why need I, in
addressing myself to you on this subject, do more than refer you to the cruel,
the savage, the bloody penal code? Leaving poor half-murdered Ireland out
of the question, what have I to do, in answer to your praises of this Church,
and your assertion as to its tolerance, but to request you to remember the
enactments in the following Acts of Old Bess, the head and the establisher of
this Church? Stat. i. chap. 1 and 2; Stat. v. chap. 1; Stat. xii. chap. 2; Stat.
xxiii. chap. 1; Stat. xxvii. chap. 2; Stat. xxix. chap. 6; Stat. xxxv. chap. 1;
Stat. xxxv. chap. 2? What have I to do, my Lord, but to request you to look
at, or rather to call to mind those laws of plunder and of blood; <i>fine, fine, fine</i>;
<i>banish, banish, banish</i>; or <i>death, death, death</i> in every line? Your Lordship
knows that this is true: you know that all these horrors, all this hellish
tyranny, that the whole arose out of a desire to make this Protestant Church
predominant. How, then, can this Protestant Church be called 'the most
tolerant in the world?' I have here given a mere sample of the doings of
this Law-Church. I have not taken your Lordship to Ireland, half-murdered
Ireland; nor have I even hinted at many acts done in England during Bess's
reign, each of which would have excited the indignation of every virtuous
man on earth; but I must not omit to mention two traits of tolerance in this
Church: <span class="smcap">First</span>, Edward VI. was advised to <i>bring his sister Mary to trial</i>, and,
of course to punishment, for not conforming to the Law-Church; and she was
saved only by the menaces of her cousin, the Emperor Charles V. <span class="smcap">Second</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_52" id="Addr_2_Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
when Mary, Queen of Scotland, had been condemned to die, she, though she
earnestly sued for it, <span class="small">WAS NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A PRIEST TO PERFORM THE
RELIGIOUS OFFICES DEEMED SO NECESSARY IN SUCH CASES</span>. They brought the
Protestant Dean of Peterborough to pray by or with her; but she would not
hear him. When her head fell from the block the Dean exclaimed, 'So let
our Queen's enemies perish!' And the Earl of Kent responded 'Amen.'
Baker in his Chronicle, p. 273, says, that the death of this Queen was earnestly
desired, because 'that if she lived, the religion received in England
could not subsist.'</p>

<p>"This Church has been no <i>changeling</i>; she has been of the same character
from the day of her establishment to the present hour; in Ireland her deeds
have surpassed those of Mahomet; but it would take a large volume to put
down a bare list of her intolerant deeds. She at last, however, seems to be
nearly at the end of her tether; the nation has always been making sacrifices
to her haughty predominance. Boulogne and Calais were the first sacrifices;
<i>poor-rates</i>, and an <i>enormous debt</i>, and a <i>standing army</i>, and a <i>civil list</i> have followed;
all, yea all, to be ascribed to the predominance of this Church, and
her haughty spirit of ascendancy. But now the nation has made so many
and such great sacrifices to her, that <i>it can make no more</i>. It cannot venture
on <i>another civil war</i> (about the <i>twentieth</i>), in order to support the ascendancy
of this Church; and be you assured, my Lord, that that hierarchy in Ireland,
to uphold which you seem so very anxious, is not much longer to be upheld
by any power on earth, seeing that all the miseries of Ireland, all of them,
without a single exception, are to be traced directly to that hierarchy: and in
these miseries <i>England sees terrific danger</i>.</p>

<p>"The case is very plain. The opponents of the Catholic Bill say, We dislike
it, because it exposes the Church, and especially the <i>Irish Church</i>, to imminent
<i>danger</i>. The answer of the Duke is, I cannot prevent this danger without
<i>risking a civil war</i>; and the State <i>cannot afford that</i>. The Law-Church
might reply, Why there have been many, many civil wars carried on for the
purpose of upholding my ascendancy; but to that the Duke might rejoin,
Very true; but we have now a paper-money-system (also made to uphold you)
<i>which cannot live in civil war</i>, and the death of which may produce that of the
State itself; and, therefore, you must be now left to support your ascendancy
by your talents, piety, zeal, charity, humility, and sound doctrine. This is
the true state of the case, my Lord, and, therefore, unless the Church can
support itself by these means, it is manifestly destined to fall.</p>

<p>Most Reverend Gentlemen, after reading the above letter,
(and mind, the writer informs you, that what he there asserts, is
proved by acts of parliament,) after reading the above letter, can
it for a moment be thought strange, that England should have
left the Catholic, and embraced the Protestant faith? Nay, is it
not more strange, with all the above <i>incontestible</i> facts before us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_53" id="Addr_2_Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
is it not, I repeat, more strange, that there should have been
left, a single Catholic, or a single fibre of Catholicity, in this
country? And had it not been for the providence of God, this
would certainly have been the case; but the Scripture beautifully
informs us, "that to them, who love God, all things work
together unto good." (<i>Rom.</i> viii., 28.)</p>

<p>But, Most Reverend Gentlemen, I have ranged over so much
spiritual ground, and have been so busily occupied in bagging
black game, that I have nearly forgotten the famous text,
"extraordinary and presumptuous movement," which your
meeting were so kind as to give me to preach from. Really, I
must not forget <i>my text</i>, otherwise you will begin to conclude, I
must be a very <i>bungling</i> preacher. Let us, then, now return to
my famous text. I think, that you must have been already convinced,
from what I have stated, in the first part of this address
to you Clergy, that your scriptural Church, has been for a long
time, making a most "extraordinary and presumptuous movement,"
on the <i>pockets</i> of Englishmen. By <i>now</i> recapitulating
what I have just said in the latter part of this address, I think
it will be also plain, that your Church has been making, for a
long time, a most "extraordinary and presumptuous movement"
on the <i>intellects</i> of Englishmen.</p>

<p>I have shown you, as above, what a beautiful Church Christ
built, which, erected on an infallible and imperishable foundation,
was to be the Church of all ages, with the world for its
boundaries, and time for its duration. I have shown you, how
your first Reformers, and your Protestant scriptural Church, had
the barefacedness to assert, that this Church of Christ once fell
into error, although <i>God</i> had pledged his solemn word, that this
Church <i>never should err</i>; I have also shown you, how this assertion
of Christ's Church falling into error, was the <i>mere</i> ipse dixit
of the <i>first</i> Reformers, and of your scriptural Church; and that
they had both unfortunately forgotten to prove, <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>, and
<i>how</i>, this <i>infallible</i> Church of Christ had fallen <i>into error</i>. Now,
I appeal to you, if this was not, a most "extraordinary and presumptuous
movement," of your scriptural Church, on the <i>intellects</i>
of Englishmen. I have also shown you, the characters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_54" id="Addr_2_Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the first Reformers, who the spiritual instructor of some of them
was, and what strange, paradoxical, and new ideas, they
advanced, and how, by forgery and lies, they contrived to palm
their new-fangled religious ideas, on the minds of the people.
Really, Gentlemen, was not this, a most "extraordinary and
presumptuous movement," of these Reformers, and of your
scriptural Church, on the <i>intellects</i> of Englishmen? I have likewise
shown you, how your scriptural Church, assures her people,
in her Thirty-nine Articles, that the Scriptures are the only
means of their salvation; and I have also shown you, how the first
Reformers and your scriptural Church, have falsified, and mutilated,
those sacred volumes. On the one hand, it is declared, that
the Scriptures are the <i>only</i> means of salvation, and on the other
hand, it is plain, that these sacred volumes, have been falsified,
and mutilated. What, then, are the people to do in this awful fix?
Really, Gentlemen, is not this, another most "extraordinary and
presumptuous movement" of your scriptural Church, on the
<i>intellects</i> of Englishmen? I have shown you, also, with what
kind of a book of Common Prayer, your Church honoured the
people. I have shown you, how, <i>at first</i> it was declared, to be
the work of the Holy Ghost; how then, it is declared <i>not</i> to be
the work of the <i>Holy Ghost</i>, but the work of <i>schism</i>; how it is
then recalled, and adopted, as a most fit means of devotion for
the people. I have shown you, how artfully God's holy Word,
and man's human inventions, are there mixed up together; and
that, when they come in contact with each other, in what strange
and paradoxical situations they place your scriptural Church.
Really, Gentlemen, is not this also a most "extraordinary and presumptuous
movement" of your scriptural Church, on the <i>intellects</i>
of Englishmen? Our Saviour declared, that his kingdom was not
of <i>this</i> world; and hence, neither he, nor his apostles, endeavoured
to propagate, and support his doctrine, by force, cruelty,
and persecution. But does not the above letter, and do not acts
of Parliament prove, that it was by bribery among the great
ones, and by force, and cruelty, and persecution, and death, on
the middle and lower classes, that your scriptural Reformation
was introduced, and forced on England? Really, Gentlemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_55" id="Addr_2_Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
was not this, a most "extraordinary and presumptuous movement"
of your scriptural Church, on the <i>consciences</i>, and on the
<i>intellects</i> of Englishmen?</p>

<p>Now, most Reverend Gentlemen, you and many of your
reverend body, have been lately calling public meetings, in
which you have unjustly endeavoured, to rouse the indignation
of the people, against the Pope for making, "an extraordinary
and presumptuous movement" on the Protestants of England.
Now I have plainly proved, in my first address, that the Pope
has <i>not</i> made an "extraordinary and presumptuous movement"
on the Protestants of England; for, by the spirit of the English
law, as I have shown, the Pope is <i>perfectly justified in all he has
done</i>. But Gentlemen, is your Protestant Church, justified <i>in
all</i> the "extraordinary and presumptuous movements," which, I
have shown, she has been making so long on <i>the pockets</i>, and on
<i>the intellects</i> of Englishmen? Certainly not. Thus you see, you
have unfortunately thrown your Scriptural Church (which feeds
you so well with more than nine millions a-year) into the very
grave, which you have been so charitably, and officiously,
unjustly digging for the poor Pope. Really, most Reverend
Gentlemen, I think every one, will conclude, that this is a most
extraordinary and presumptuous movement, of <i>you</i> and <i>your</i>
reverend body, on your good, and kind mother the Church.
May they not justly apply to you, the words of the old proverb,
"Physicians, cure yourselves?" Most Reverend Gentlemen, to
those clergymen, who have adopted the above inconsistent
conduct, I can only say, I may applaud their intentions, but I
must condemn their bigotry. They may indeed, be friends to
their Church in their hearts, but their mouths, and pens, are her
most dangerous enemies.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, I beg leave to say a few words about the
Puseyites, a few words to the dissenters, and a few words to the
English people; and then, I must drop the curtain, and beg
leave to retire for the present.</p>

<p>There is a circumstance, connected with the Whitby meeting,
upon which I have as yet made no remark. You came
together, on that occasion, both ministers and people, obedient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_56" id="Addr_2_Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
to the trumpet call of Lord John Russell. Now, that trumpet
blew two blasts, which gave "no uncertain sound." The <i>first</i>,
was to denounce the papal aggression; the <i>second</i>, was to warn
you of "a danger, which alarmed him (Lord John Russell) much
more than any aggression of a foreign sovereign; alarmed him
more, than Pope and Cardinal Archbishop, and territorial titles
put together, more than the hierarchy, with all its mapping,
and parcelling out of the land, nay, more to be dreaded, than
an invasion of England, by the fleets and armies of any earthly
power!" In the name of all that is terrible, what is this danger,
that is impending over us? He says that it is a danger,
"<i>already within the gates</i>." What does he mean? Why,
Gentlemen, he means (and you all know it) Puseyism, and
Popery, which have long been spreading, in the <i>very bosom</i> of the
<i>Protestant</i> Church of England. Lord John proclaims to you,
<i>this latter</i> danger, even more loudly than <i>the former</i>; and yet,
upon <i>this latter</i> "extraordinary and presumptuous movement,"
<i>you</i> were silent at <i>your</i> meeting, <i>each</i> and <i>all</i>; you heard him
proclaiming, that the abomination of desolation, had got possession
of the holy place; and that the bewitching fascination,
of the Harlot of Rome, had reduced even some of the Protestant
Bishops, into dalliance with her; and yet, <i>not one</i> word, from
<i>any</i> minister among <i>you</i>, Protestant, Independent, or Wesleyan,
<i>not one word</i> either <i>to deny</i> the existence of the danger, or to
propose means to <i>ward</i> it off. You <i>readily</i> flocked together, to
repel the <i>lesser</i> danger, but, the <i>much more</i> alarming danger,
(according to Lord John) the danger "within the gates," it
seemed touched <i>you not at all</i>. Really, <i>in this</i> you appear, to be
worthy disciples of Lord John Russell, who sat nearly seven
years, under the Rev. Mr. Bennett, with all this danger staring
him in the face, and yet, blew not <i>then</i> a <i>single</i> blast of his <i>warning</i>
trumpet. Really, Gentlemen, what was the cause of your
silence, on this occasion? Was it lack of zeal, or lack of
courage on your part? We shall, perhaps, be better able to
judge of this, when I have told you, what sort of Puseyite enormities,
Lord John has detected in the Church, and how, he
takes upon himself, to chastise and correct them. Never, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_57" id="Addr_2_Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the days of Cromwell, the Vicar-General of Henry VIII., has
any layman, or churchman either, dared to play such tricks,
or brandish such a rod, in the face of the Church of England,
as this imperious minister has done! Mark, how this leader of
the House of Commons, this lay Metropolitan of all England, superseding
both York and Canterbury, see, how he calls to account his
venerable brother, the Bishop of Durham. "Clergymen of our
Church, who have subscribed the thirty-nine articles, and acknowledged
the Queen's supremacy, have been the most forward, to
lead their flocks, step by step, to the very verge of the precipice."
Well, sad shepherds these, to lead their flocks, to the very verge of
the precipice, and <i>sadder still</i>, that one thousand, eight hundred of
these Church of England Clergymen, have signed a protest,
<i>against the Queen's supremacy as recently</i> exercised; thus rebelling,
against the acknowledged, and sworn head of their Church.
Well, Lord John thus describes the danger, "within the gates."</p>

<p>(1.) The honour paid to saints; (2.) the claim of infallibility
for the Church; (3.) the superstitious use of the sign of the
cross; (4.) the muttering of the liturgy, so as to disguise the
language, in which it is written; (5.) the recommendation of
auricular confession; (6.) the administration of penance, and
(7.) absolution.</p>

<p>All these things, are pointed out by <i>certain</i> clergymen of the
<i>Church</i> of <i>England</i>, as worthy of adoption! Here, according to
Lord John Russell, is the "enemy within the gates." Here, are
seven enormous errors, pointed out by a layman, as corrupting,
and disfiguring the pure, the Scriptural, the reformed Church of
England. I will make a few remarks on each, marking the
number of each, as I proceed.</p>

<p>(1st. The honour paid to saints.) So certain Reverend Gentlemen
of the Church of England, are no longer to honour the
saints, as they have done; the Whig prime minister, will not
permit it. But can it be, that Lord John here intimates, that
these Protestant Clergymen, have been paying <i>divine</i> honour to
the saints? Why, this would be idolatry! "Thou that abhorrest
idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?" Catholics, indeed, honour
the saints, but a true Catholic, would sooner die, than give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_58" id="Addr_2_Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
<i>divine</i> honour to any saint, or to all the saints in bliss. But,
whether you Reverend Protestant Gentlemen, are to honour
them at all, or with what sort of honour, or with what degree of
it; all this you will learn, perhaps, from Lord John Russell, or
from some of his Bishops. In the meantime, you had better
observe the <i>Protestant</i> Church doctrine, as to holy angels, laid
down in your <i>Protestant</i> collect, on the feast of St. Michael, where
your scriptural Church, prays, that "the holy angels, may, by
God's appointment, succour and defend us on earth." (Coll. of
St. Mich. Ch. Eng. Prayer Book.) Surely, this doctrine of your
Church of England prayer book, will not alarm Lord John Russell,
and surely, the Bishop of London, will not openly reprehend
this, in his next charge, to the clergy of his diocese; although,
in my humble opinion, it smells very strongly of the popish doctrine
of angels, and saints, and looks very like, leading the people,
step by step, to the very verge of that precipice.</p>

<p>(2ndly. The claim of infallibility for the Church.) It seems,
some of you, Reverend Gentlemen, have had the <i>temerity</i> to
preach up, the infallibility of the Church. <i>This</i>, is to be "put
down." <i>You</i> are not to claim <i>infallibility</i> for <i>your</i> Church.
Infallibility belongs to the <i>Catholic</i> Church, which is "built upon
a rock," which is the "pillar and ground of truth," "formed
upon the prophets, and apostles, having Christ for its chief corner
stone," with which Church Christ has promised, "to abide
all days, even to the end of the world." Such is the Catholic
Church, according to the <i>Scriptures</i>. But, as regards <i>your
Church</i>, Reverend Gentlemen, you are to be diligent in teaching,
that your Church is <i>not</i> infallible, is not built upon a rock, <i>not</i>
founded upon the prophets and apostles,&mdash;has not Christ for its
chief corner stone,&mdash;for if <i>she had</i>, she would <i>assuredly</i> be <i>infallible</i>.
But above all, you are to teach, either that Christ did <i>not</i>
promise, to be always with His Church, or that, even his abiding
presence, with the Church, is <i>not</i> sufficient to make <i>her</i> infallible;
at all events, you are to teach (if you teach anything) that <i>your</i>
Church, has <i>no claims</i> to infallibility, and that she may be
involved in the grossest errors, and may be altogether, misleading
and deluding, both you and your flocks. This shows, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_59" id="Addr_2_Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
a cuckoo cry, that was, which the vicar of Leeds, was sometime
ago, sounding with <i>such iteration</i>, from the housetops, crying,
"<span class="small">HEAR THE CHURCH</span>." This cry, has died away, and I suspect,
Dr. Hook will not <i>renew</i> it, with the return of spring. For why,
in the name of common sense, should we hear, or follow the
guidance of this Church of England, which does not pretend, to
be a <i>sure</i> and <i>infallible</i> guide? Or where indeed, shall we find the
Church? In convocation? that has been extinguished. In
synod? She is not permitted to hold one. On the bench of
Bishops? The Bishops, are <i>notoriously</i> at sixes and sevens, all
over the land, both on matters of <i>faith</i>, <i>discipline</i>, and <i>ceremonies</i>.</p>

<p>Yours, Reverend Gentlemen, is a <i>hard</i> lot! I know nothing to
equal to it. You glory in liberty of conscience, and are the bound
slaves of a <i>fallible</i> Church, as if she were <i>infallible</i>. The Bible, and
the Bible alone, is your rule of faith, and yet, you are remorselessly
compelled, to subscribe to the thirty-nine Articles, which have been
<i>added</i> to the Scriptures, and which are in part self-contradictory,
and in part, impossible to be understood.<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> You exult in freedom
of thought, and in the privilege of private interpretation, but if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_60" id="Addr_2_Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
you <i>dare</i> to exercise <i>either</i>, you are dragged to the ecclesiastical
courts, to answer for your temerity, at the bar of a Lay Judge.
Ah! Reverend Gentlemen, Cranmer, and Latimer, and Ridley,
did an <i>evil</i> thing; they bowed their <i>own</i> necks, and prepared for
<i>your</i> necks, a galling yoke, when to rid themselves of the supremacy,
of the divinely appointed head of the Church, they cried
out, "we have no king but Csar." From <i>that</i> day to <i>this</i>, Parliament,
and Parliamentary leaders, have lorded it, over your
inheritance, both <i>spiritual</i> and <i>temporal</i>. You <i>must</i> either submit
to <i>Lay</i> tribunals, or there are <i>no loaves</i> and <i>fishes</i> for <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>How beautifully is your Church thus described by the poet,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For she was of that stubborn crew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of errant saints, whom all men grant,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As if religion were intended,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For nothing else, but to be mended."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(3rdly. The superstitious use of the sign of the cross.) The
true Catholic, knows that the Son of God, obtained the salvation
of the world, by dying <i>on a cross</i>, for all mankind; and
hence, like the great St. Paul, he glories in the cross of Christ,
and frequently crosses himself, with this holy sign, to remind
himself of Jesus Christ, who obtained so many spiritual blessings
for mankind, by the great sacrifice, which he once consummated
<i>on the cross</i>. Hence the Catholic Church, keeps the
cross, as the sign of the pledge of our redemption, in all her
churches, and chapels, and by this holy sign, reminds the faithful,
that all the blessings, that they either <i>have</i> received, or <i>can</i>
receive, <i>must</i> come through the <i>merits</i> of Jesus Christ. Hence,
in the oblation of her holy sacrifice, in the administration of her
sacraments, and in all her sacred rites, and ceremonies, she is
continually using this holy sign, to remind both herself, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_61" id="Addr_2_Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
faithful, that it is by the cross, that is, by the merits of our
Saviour's death, and passion, that she, and all other faithful, are
to triumph over the world, the flesh, and the devil. Hence, this
sign was used by antiquity with the greatest veneration. Thus,
Tertullian beautifully says, "We sign ourselves with the sign of
the cross, on the forehead, whenever we go from home, or return,
when we put on our clothes, or our shoes, when we go to the
bath, or sit down to meat, when we light our candles, when we
lie down, and when we sit." But it appears, that the superstitious
use of the sign of the cross, is offensive to Lord John, and,
that it may lead people, step by step, to the very verge of the
precipice; and therefore, you clergymen, must not make use of
the sign of the cross, but you must keep the lion, and the unicorn,
in <i>your</i> churches, to remind the people, that <i>your</i> church
is the church of men, as by Law established. You may indeed,
bow at the name of Jesus, and kiss the Bible, before you swear
by it, in a court of justice, but, in the house of God, you had
better omit the superstitious use of the sign of the cross,
although, if <i>one</i> of the popish ceremonies be <i>superstitious</i>, it is
manifest that the <i>other two</i> ceremonies, must be <i>also superstitious</i>.</p>

<p>(4thly. The muttering of the liturgy, so as to disguise the language,
in which it is written.) Now, what this sentence really
means, I am at a loss to divine; whether, it refers to the indistinct
utterance, of the clergyman's enunciation, or it means,
that some of these Protestant clergymen, have been performing
certain parts, of the Church of England liturgy, like Catholics,
in the Latin tongue, I am at a loss to determine. It is a pity,
when Lord John is finding fault, about muttering, so as to disguise
the language, (and of course the meaning,) of his Church
liturgy, it is really a pity, Lord John did not express himself, in
more intelligible terms; but, perhaps, the obscurity of Lord
John's meaning, may be owing to the blunt acumen of my
popish understanding. I am rather, however, inclined to think,
that Lord John, is here warning his clergy, against the use of
the Latin tongue, in the Church liturgy, and if so, he is perfectly
right. For the English Protestant Church, is a <i>modern</i> church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_62" id="Addr_2_Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
its <i>language</i>, therefore, should be <i>modern</i>, that its <i>liturgy</i>, may
announce to posterity the period, in which it was formed. But
the Church of Rome, is an <i>ancient</i> Church, and therefore, <i>she</i>
preserves her <i>ancient</i> liturgy, the language of which, remounts to
the <i>origin</i> of Christianity. I do not believe, that history, can
furnish an instance of a people, who ever changed the language
of their liturgy, and who did not, at the same time, change their
religion. But are the Catholics of the Latin Church, singular
in the use of an ancient tongue, in their service? Certainly not.
The Greeks, Russians, Armenians, Syrians, Copts, Ethiopians,
Georgians, and the other Christians of the East, all retain the
liturgies, which they received from the fathers of their faith,
and which are written in languages, unintelligible to the common
people. The same, was the discipline of the Jews, after
their captivity; and we do not find, that it was ever blamed by
Our Saviour. But is it true, that the modern Church of England,
has always held in such abhorrence, the celebration of her
liturgy, in an unknown tongue? certainly not: for, in the year
1560, an act was passed, for the introduction of the English
Protestant Common Prayer Book, among the natives of Ireland,
who were compelled, by the severest penalties, to assist at the
celebration of the English liturgy; though these poor Irish, were
<i>utterly</i> unacquainted, with the English language. Hence, Dr.
Heylin, in his History of the Protestant Reformation, (Eliz. p.
128.) says, "The people, by that statute, are required under
severe penalties, to frequent their churches, and to be frequent,
at the reading of the <i>English</i> liturgy, which they understand, <i>no
more</i> than they do the Mass." *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* "By which," continues
this Protestant writer, "we have furnished the Papists, with an
excellent argument against ourselves, for having the divine service
celebrated in <i>such</i> a language, as the people do <i>not</i> understand."</p>

<p>But is the adoption of the Latin tongue, peculiar only to
some of the Protestant Clergymen, of the present day? I
answer no; for in the Act of Uniformity, the Protestant minister
in Ireland, if he could not read the <i>English</i>, was permitted
to read a <i>Latin</i> translation, which was, no doubt, equally <i>unin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_63" id="Addr_2_Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>telligible</i>
to the most of his parishioners. (See Dr. Heylin's
Hist., as above.) In the same year, the Universities of Oxford,
and Cambridge, and the Colleges of Eton, and Winchester,
obtained permission from the head of their Church, to perform
the divine service in the language of Rome. (Wilk. Conc. Tom.
iv., p. 217.) Thus you see, that the muttering of the Liturgy,
so as to disguise the language, in which it was written, is not (if
I understand rightly Lord John's meaning,) is not peculiar only
to some of you Protestant ministers of the present day; for it
was claimed and exercised by some of your Protestant ancestors.
But then, we all know, Lord John is a consistent and
straight-forward man, and therefore, he may perhaps wish you,
to adopt in your Liturgy, a <i>modern</i> language, significant of
the <i>modern</i> origin of your Church, and therefore, he may perhaps
wish you to show, by the language of your Liturgy, that
your Church, is <i>so many</i> hundred years <i>too late, to be the Church
of Christ</i>.</p>

<p>But if the muttering of the Liturgy, &amp;c., by the Clergy,
be a great crime, is it not a far greater crime, for the Protestant
Bishops, and clergymen, so to mutter the tenets of their
creed, as to disguise the language, and the meaning of them, by
their perpetual disunions, and contradictions? Is it not a <i>notorious</i>
fact, that in <i>one</i> Protestant Church, you are taught to
believe in ecclesiastical infallibility, in <i>another</i>, in the all-sufficiency
of the Scriptures; in <i>one</i> Protestant parish, you have a
sacrificial, mediatorial priest, in <i>another</i>, one of an opposite, and
contrary opinion; in <i>one</i> Protestant Church, you have an altar,
in <i>another</i>, you have a communion table; in <i>one</i> Bishop's See,
the Protestant prelate <i>rigorously</i> insists, on the <i>necessity</i> of spiritual
regeneration by baptism, in <i>another</i> Bishop's See, it is acknowledged
to be an <i>unnecessary</i> act of religion; in Pimlico
Protestant Church, you have auricular confession <i>insisted on</i>, in
a Liverpool Protestant Church, you have the <i>punishment of death</i>,
recommended as a <i>penalty</i> for such a practice; in short, is it
not <i>notorious</i> (as I said before) that the Protestant Bishops, and
Clergymen, are at sixes, and sevens, all over the land, about
<i>their articles of faith</i>, <i>matters of discipline</i> and <i>ceremonies</i>? Really,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_64" id="Addr_2_Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
what are the people to do, amidst all this disunion, and dissension
about their religion, so as to disguise, and confound the
sense, and meaning of its tenets? Had not Lord John Russell,
better have called his bishops, and Clergy to an account, on <i>this</i>
Babel muttering of religion, before he chastised them, for the
muttering of <i>the Liturgy</i>? The building of the mighty tower of
Babel, was arrested, and demolished by the confusion of tongues;
and be assured, most Reverend Gentlemen, unless your Scriptural
Church, changes this muttering, and confusion of tongues, of
her weathercock, and Babel faith, and doctrines, she must also
be demolished. For does not the Scripture, plainly tell us, that
"a house divided against itself, cannot stand?" and the rains
(of fallibility, and of muttering the Liturgy, &amp;c.) fell, and the
floods (of clerical protestant dissensions) came, and the winds
(of disunion among the bishops, about the necessity of baptismal
regeneration) blew; and they beat upon that house, (the Protestant,
fallible, Babel, Church,) and it fell; and great was the
<i>golden</i> fall thereof, for it was built, <i>not</i> upon the rock of God's
<i>infallible</i> word, but upon the mere <i>fallible inventions</i>, and <i>pecuniary
conveniences</i> of men.</p>

<p>(5th. The recommendation of Auricular Confession, to which,
I beg to add (the 7th) Absolution.)</p>

<p>Every well-instructed Catholic, knows that no man, <i>as man</i>,
can forgive sins; but at the same time, he knows, that <i>God</i> can
forgive sins, and that God, <i>can</i> give that power to <i>man</i>; for the
Apostles were men, and yet, Jesus Christ (as I shall shortly
shew) gave his Apostles, a power to forgive sins. You know,
that our Saviour, was both God and man, and that he acted,
sometimes as God, and sometimes, as man. Now, if you will
read the ninth chapter of St. Matthew's Gospel, you will find,
that our Saviour worked a miracle, to prove that He as man,
(but mind assisted by his heavenly Father) had power to forgive
sins, even on earth. Now, he gave this power, also to his Apostles,
for we read in St. John's Gospel, (chap. xx. 22,) He
"breathed upon them," and said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost:
whose sins, you shall forgive, they are forgiven; and whose sins
you shall retain, they are retained." Now, why was not this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_65" id="Addr_2_Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
power of forgiving sins, to extend also to <i>future</i> ages? Are not
God, and Jesus Christ, as good and as kind, <i>now</i>, as they were,
in the <i>time</i> of the Apostles; and are there not, as many sinners
<i>now</i>, as there were <i>then</i>? If therefore, God, and Jesus Christ,
in their infinite mercy, gave this power of forgiving sins, <i>to the
Apostles</i>, for the good of mankind then, and if there are, as many
sinners <i>now</i>, as there were <i>then</i>, in the name of common sense,
why was not this power of God, given to the Apostles for the
benefit of mankind <i>then</i>, why was it not, to extend also to all
<i>future</i> ages, for the benefit of mankind <i>afterwards</i>? No such
things, cries out the Lay Metropolitan of England. Such doctrine,
would lead the people, step by step, to the very verge of
the precipice. But of what precipice? Would you believe it?
to the recommendation of Auricular Confession, and Absolution,
as laid down, in the <i>Church of England Prayer-book</i>.</p>

<p>In the Church of England form of Ordination, the Bishop
says, to the candidate for the priesthood: "Receive ye the Holy
Ghost: whose sins ye shall forgive, they are forgiven, and whose
sins ye shall retain, they are retained." These words, most
Reverend Gentlemen, were said over each of you, by your
Bishops, when you presented yourselves candidates, for ordination.
Now, did you receive any spiritual power, or was this a
mere form? If you answer, it was a mere form, you then have
no more power, in this respect, than a mere layman; but if you
answer, you did receive a power, it must have been, either a
<i>declaratory</i>, or a <i>judicial</i> power to forgive sins; if it was only a
<i>declaratory</i> power, viz., to declare, that the sinner, would obtain
forgiveness if he truly repented, then, <i>any layman</i>, possesses this
power <i>without ordination</i>; for any layman, can confidently
declare, that <i>penitent</i> sinners are pardoned; but if you received
a <i>judicial</i> power, to forgive sins, then, this is popish doctrine,
and this would lead you, and your flock, step by step, to the
very verge of the precipice. But to the verge of what precipice?
Why your Protestant common prayer-book, shall now tell you.
Really, most Reverend Gentlemen, I am afraid of quoting this
passage, from your prayer-book; for it will not <i>merely lead</i> you
to <i>the verge</i>, but it will <i>hurl</i> you, all headlong, down the preci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_66" id="Addr_2_Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>pice
of the popish doctrine, of Auricular Confession, and
Absolution.</p>

<p>But we had better, go step by step, and therefore, I will quote
a <i>choice piece</i>, that occurs in your Protestant common prayer-book,
just before the recommendation of Auricular Confession,
and Absolution. Your godly prayer-book, says, in the visitation
of the sick, "the ministers shall not omit, earnestly to move,
such sick persons, as are of ability, <i>to be liberal to the poor</i>." It is
a pity, O godly Church, that thou didst not give this advice to
thyself, at the Reformation, when thou stolest, so much money
from the poor, and then, made the nation make up, by church-rates
and poor-rates, for what thou hadst stolen. Thou art
really a very disinterested spiritual physician, for thou art most
solicitous about thy children, practising the virtue of <i>charity
themselves</i>, but as for <i>thyself</i>, thou will practise charity, as soon
as it is convenient, or as soon as the spirit moves thee, or the
nation makes thee.</p>

<p>But what comes next, in your godly prayer-book? Why,
rank, and downright Popish doctrine, of auricular confession,
and absolution. In the visitation of the sick, your prayer-book
thus says; "Here shall the sick person be moved to make a
<span class="small">SPECIAL</span> confession of <i>his sins</i>, if he feel his conscience, troubled
with any weighty matter. After which <i>confession</i>, the Priest
shall absolve him (if he humbly and earnestly desire it) after
this sort: Our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath left power to His
Church, to absolve all sinners, who truly repent, and believe in
Him; of His great mercy, forgive thee thine offences: and by
His authority <span class="small">COMMITTED TO ME</span>, I <i>absolve</i> thee from all thy sins,
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost. Amen." Really, most Reverend Gentlemen, if all this,
is not rank popish, auricular confession, and absolution, I know
not what is; and <i>mind</i>, standing as large as life, in <i>your</i> Church
of England, Common Prayer-book, which was made by act of
parliament, by "the aid of the Holy Ghost, and for the honour
of God." Really, what are you, and Lord John Russell to do
<i>now</i>, when your Protestant godly Prayer-book, has not only <i>led</i>
you to <i>the verge</i>, but <i>hurled</i> you all headlong down to the <i>very</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_67" id="Addr_2_Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
bottom, of popish Auricular Confession, and absolution? Why,
you must either renounce your Protestant prayer-book, and
declare, it is <i>not</i> a work of the Holy Ghost, nor made for the
honour of God; or your orthodox stomachs, must swallow, by
wholesale, <i>this abomination of desolation</i>, of popish auricular
confession, and absolution; and thus, allow the dreadful enemy,
to remain "within your gates," an enemy more terrible than an
hostile invasion by foreign powers.</p>

<p>(6th. The administration of Penance.) This, most Reverend
Gentlemen, is the sixth error, in Lord John Russell's catalogue,
of seven errors, but the last, which I have to answer, as I have
already, included the seventh, in the fifth error. If Lord John,
wishes to intimate, that Catholics teach works of penance, to be
of <i>themselves</i> a <i>sufficient</i> compensation for sin, Lord John has yet,
to learn, the <i>first</i> rudiments of the Catholic creed; but if he
means, that Catholics consider the works of penance, as one of
the conditions, on which our Saviour, is willing to communicate
the merits of His death and passion, to the soul of the sinner,
Lord John's meaning is just. But does Lord John, seriously
condemn this doctrine, founded, as it is, on the plainest evidence
of scripture, and confirmed by the practice of the earliest ages?
If I understand Lord John rightly, he certainly does. Lord
John, is perhaps the zealous champion of the all-sufficiency of
Christ, and in his opinion, to do penance for sin, after the great
sacrifice consummated on the cross, is to lead the people, step
by step, to the verge of an awful precipice. If this, is Lord
John's creed, it must, at least, be a very consoling one.
Indulge your passions, it exclaims, to the sinner, indulge your
passions, and cease to sin, when you can sin no longer; fear not
the rigours of penance; to weep and pray, to fast and give
alms, to repent in sackcloth and ashes, are external ceremonies,
which are confined to the popish creed; but to practise them, in
our <i>new</i> dispensation of <i>free</i> grace, <i>as by law established</i>, would be,
to lead the people, to the very verge of the popish precipice. It
is curious to observe, how Lord John's liberation from penance (if
I understand him rightly,) has improved, on the rough sketch,
which was delivered by our forefathers. St. Paul, was accus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_68" id="Addr_2_Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>tomed
to keep under his body, and to bring it under subjection
by acts of penance; and I have no doubt, he thought he was
acting in a manner, pleasing to Christ, and yet, we learn from
Lord John's doctrine, (if I understand it rightly,) this great
apostle, was leading the people, step by step, to the very verge,
of the awful precipice of penance. The penitents in ancient
times, often spent whole years in works of penance; they fasted
and prayed, they lay prostrate at the porch of the Church, they
solicited the intercession of their less guilty brethren. By these
penitential austerities, they hoped, they were fulfilling the will
of the Redeemer, and yet, alas! according to Lord John's
doctrine (if I understand it rightly) they were going, step by
step, to the very verge of the awful precipice of penance. Even
the learned men, who compiled the Church of England, Common
Prayer-book, appear to have been involved in this awful error.
"There was formerly," they tell us, "a godly discipline, that at
the beginning of Lent, such persons, as stood convicted of notorious
sins, were put to open penance, and punished here, that
their souls, might be saved at the day of the Lord; and it were
much to be wished, that this said discipline, may be restored."
(Church Eng. Com. Pray. book.) Little did they imagine, that this
godly discipline of penance, by means of which the souls of
sinners, were to be saved in the day of the Lord, would be
reproved by a Protestant layman, as an error, which would lead
people, step by step, to the verge of an awful precipice. Yet so
(if I understand his meaning) says Lord John Russell, and he is
lay Metropolitan of all England.</p>

<p>I think I cannot better take leave of Lord John, than by
addressing him in the words of the Reverend Mr. Bennett,
under whose Puseyite teaching, he sat for some time. "If my
course was insidious, (Lord John), why did you take part in that
course? If I so muttered the liturgy, as to disguise its language,
why did <i>you</i> join in so glaring a profaneness, for nearly
seven years? If I practised 'mummeries and superstition,'
why did <i>you</i>, come to join in them, for nearly seven years?
Why did <i>you</i> so far and so deeply join, as to receive at my
hands, so late as Ash Wednesday, 1849, the holy Eucharist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_69" id="Addr_2_Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
yourself and your family? If I were one, of those designated in
your letter, as bringing a greater danger, than the Pope, why
then, my lord, was it, that <i>you</i> said not all this before?" (Rev.
Mr. Bennett's Letter to Lord John Russell.)</p>

<p>In conclusion, I can only say, that I am afraid Lord John
Russell's letter, has been a most <i>unfortunate one for himself</i>;
and as such, I regret it exceedingly. It has certainly placed
him, in the opinion of sensible Englishmen, in a very ridiculous
point of view; and how it will be received by future ages, it is
not for me to divine.</p>

<p>My dissenting Brethren, to you who have honourably come
forward, and assisted us Catholics, in the late hurricane of
bigotry, and of insults, I return you my mead of sincere thanks.
Your conduct shows, that you have acted the part of consistent
men, that you are true supporters of civil and religious liberty,
and that you have not forgotten the former noble, and disinterested
exertions of the late Daniel O'Connell, in your cause. You
cannot but remember, that the late Daniel O'Connell, nobly and
disinterestedly, battled for <i>your</i> rights and privileges, on the
field of civil and religious liberty, <i>even before</i> he had gained those
rights, either for the English Catholics, or for his dear country,
poor Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_70" id="Addr_2_Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<p>But what shall I say of those dissenters, who have joined with
the Protestant Church, in the late fury and tirade against
us Catholics? Can I call <i>them consistent</i> men? Consistent men
indeed! Do not all the dissenters, the Presbyterians, Methodists,
Independents, Baptists, Unitarians, and Quakers, do not all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_71" id="Addr_2_Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
these dissenters deny, as well as we Catholics, the spiritual
supremacy of the Queen? Nay, do not all these dissenters,
claim <i>their</i> spiritual rights and authority, <i>independent of the
Queen</i>? Why, therefore, will you refuse the exercise of their
spiritual rights, to your <i>Catholic</i> fellow creatures? Why will you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_72" id="Addr_2_Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
unjustly deprive <i>them</i> of those privileges, which are the <i>birth-right</i>
of <i>every</i> Englishman; nay, of every human creature in the
world? Does not the scripture, which you so often extol, tell
you, "that you ought not to do unto others, that which you do
not wish others to do unto you?" What, then, are we to say of
those dissenting ministers, or minister, who on one day are seen
claiming the power to give spiritual ordination to others, then,
shortly after, attending an Anti-Protestant Church meeting; and,
lastly, see them or him, arranged by the side of the <i>Protestant</i>
Church, for the express purpose, of refusing to the <i>Catholic</i>
Church, the exercise of those spiritual rights, which they, or he,
had not long before deemed it their, or his right to assume?
Nay, what is still worse, he had <i>even</i> wished to refuse them the
rights of a base criminal, viz., that a charitable dissenter should
not be allowed to speak, or merely ask a question, in defence of the
Pope, and of the benighted papists. Really, was not <i>this</i>, a most
inconsistent, "extraordinary and presumptuous movement," of
this dissenting minister? Well, I can only say, if the <i>religious</i>
creed of this minister, be not <i>more consistent</i> than his <i>political</i>
creed, I really envy him not the possession of it, and I think I
cannot do better, than address him in the words of the poet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His notions fitted things so well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, which was which, he could not tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oftentimes, mistook the one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For t'other, as great clerks have done."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I must now say a few words to the English, in general, and
make a few remarks on the unjust manner, in which the Catholic
religion, has in general been hitherto, treated and abused.
That you may the better understand this, I will make use of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_73" id="Addr_2_Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
following supposition. Let us suppose, for a moment, that we
were in a court of justice, that a person was going to be tried,
that some of you were witnesses against him, that the rest of
you, were to form the jury, and that I was to be the judge.
Now, if we were to examine, <i>only</i> the witnesses who were <i>against</i>
the accused, and <i>not</i> allow a <i>single</i> individual to speak for him,
if we were not, to allow the poor man to speak a word in his
<i>own</i> defence, and were the jury, and the judge, then to pronounce
him guilty, do you think, we should treat that man
<i>fairly</i>? <i>However innocent</i> he might be, he was sure to be brought
in <i>guilty</i>. And why? Because the witnesses were against him,
the jury was against him, and the judge was against him; and
not a single word was allowed to be spoken in his defence.
Now, ye honest men of England, would you not think that man
was treated very <i>unfairly</i>? Would you not feel for such a man?
And would you not pity his case? I am sure you would, and
all with one voice exclaim, "Let the poor man have <i>fair play</i>,
and let <i>us</i> 'do to <i>him</i>, as <i>we</i> would be done by.'"</p>

<p>Now, my friends, let us apply this example, to the Catholic
religion. Have you not read books, that gave you the most
horrible account of the Catholic religion, have you not heard
people, tell the most infamous things against this religion, and
have you not, <i>even</i> in places of <i>worship</i>, heard this religion, most
<i>cruelly</i> called, and abused? But did you ever ask yourselves,
whether all that you then read or heard, was <i>really</i> true? Did
you consider, that abuse, is no argument, declamation, no evidence,
accusation, no verdict? Did you examine the witnesses
on the <i>other</i> side? Did you read any <i>Catholic</i> book, or consult
any well-instructed <i>Catholic</i> layman, or minister on these subjects?
Did you not condemn the poor Catholics, <i>unheard</i>, and
without giving them a <i>fair</i> trial? But mind, I am not blaming
<i>you</i>, nor the <i>public in general</i>, for this ignorance of our religion,
nor am I surprised at it. No, considering what has been the
state of things, I cannot conceive how it could have been otherwise.
For these misrepresentations, and false statements against
our religion, have been often made by very <i>respectable</i> persons,
and often repeated to the people, either from <i>the pulpit, where</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_74" id="Addr_2_Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
nothing but the <i>truth</i>, should be spoken, or in tracts, and books,
which either <i>are</i>, or <i>profess to be</i> written by <i>learned</i> and <i>sincere</i>
members of society. Thus hearing these statements, and accusations,
from <i>these</i> sources, the people very natural enough conclude,
that all that is said against the poor <i>benighted</i> Papists,
<i>must be true</i>. But my friends, I beg of you that <i>in future</i>, you
will always remember, that the law of England, strictly forbids
any one, even the <i>basest criminal</i>, to be condemned <i>before</i>, he has
had a <i>fair</i> trial, that it is an excellent maxim in life, "hear <i>both</i>
sides <i>before</i> you <i>judge</i>," and the Scripture expressly says: "Thou
shalt not bear <i>false</i> witness against <i>thy</i> neighbour." Why should
not then the <i>same</i> principles, be adopted in <i>judging</i> of the <i>Catholic</i>
religion? When then, in future your hear any abuse, or accusation
against the Catholic religion, I beg of you to ask yourselves
two questions: <i>First, am I certain</i> that the <i>Catholic</i> Church
maintains <i>such</i> doctrine? and <i>secondly, if it does</i>, have I heard
the <i>proofs</i>, which may be advanced, <i>in confirmation</i> of <i>that</i> doctrine?
Oh! would only all Englishmen, grant the Catholics
this common boon of justice! how soon would that dark, and
heavy cloud of prejudice and misrepresentation, which has so
long hung over our religion, immediately burst, and as the sun,
after having been shrouded in clouded majesty, amidst the terrific
storm, bursts forth with more transcendent brightness, so
would the Catholic faith, after having been so long darkened
with the mist of false representation, burst forth, with a lustre
and brightness, which could not help attracting the eye of every
sensible, and thinking mind.</p>

<p>One or two more remarks to you Englishmen, and then, I
really must for the present bid you farewell. You cannot be
ignorant of the many Protestant clergyman, who, are either
returning in <i>many</i> respects to the Catholic faith, or who have
<i>already, publicly</i> renounced the <i>Protestant</i>, and embraced the
<i>Catholic</i> faith. Now, with all these venerable examples before
<i>you</i>, ought not <i>you laity</i>, to begin to think, that <i>you also</i>, have a
right, nay, that it is <i>your duty</i>, to examine how religious affairs,
stand in England? You cannot read, without feelings of
interest, and surprise, the account of the <i>numerous</i> conversions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_75" id="Addr_2_Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of these <i>Protestant</i> clergymen, to the <i>ancient Catholic</i>. Although
you may condemn the change, still you cannot but admire the
singleness of their purpose, and the strength of their minds.
The Catholic Church, has no <i>earthly</i> treasures (for the Protestant
Church got all these long since) to offer these ministers for
the great sacrifice of wealth, of friendship, and other worldly
interests, which they have to forfeit, for <i>renouncing</i> the <i>Protestant</i>,
and <i>embracing</i> the <i>Catholic</i> faith. On the other hand,
your rich, but poor in spirit Church, lays before them <i>golden</i>
prospects, some of the best, and highest preferments of your
Church. But, they have turned their backs upon them all,
either to accept the lowly charge of a Catholic Priest, or to sink
into some despised, and humble situation in life. To many of
you, these sacrifices may appear folly; but remember these converts,
have lately studied in the school of St. Paul, who "suffered
the loss of all things, and accounted them as dung, that
he might gain Christ." (Phil. iii.) Thus, they have cheerfully
renounced the riches, and honours of this world, to associate
themselves in faith, and worship, with those holy, and illustrious
members of the Catholic faith, who, in every age, and clime,
have made it their aim, and glory, to bring their dear, but erring
brethren, to this one fold, of the one Shepherd, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>I can only say it appears to me strange, passing strange,
that if Catholicity be such a monster, as some would gladly
persuade the world, it appears very strange, that there
should be such an inclination in England, of late years, to
return to this ancient faith. Every one must acknowledge, that
the march of intellect in England, during these late years, has
been immense; but if Catholicity be such a monster, as our
enemies <i>charitably</i> represent it, what is the reason, so many are
beginning to enter into its fold, and what is the reason, Catholicity
in England is so much in the increase? This great
increase, is acknowledged even by our enemies. One would
<i>reasonably</i> think, that if Catholicity be such a monster, the
march of intellect would have <i>naturally</i> guarded the people
against it. It surely will not be said, that the people have not
been sufficiently warned against it. What! not sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_76" id="Addr_2_Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
warned against it! Have they not been warned against it, these
three hundred years at least? Have they not been warned
against it, in books of all descriptions, from the large folio to the
penny tract? Have they not been warned against it, in almost
every pulpit (except Catholic) in England? Have they not
been warned against it, again, and again, in the House of Lords
and Commons? Have they not been warned against it, in
almost every rank of society? In short, have they not been
warned against it by every means, that human ingenuity could
devise? But surely, we shall not be told, that this inclination
to Catholicity, is owing to the want of scriptural knowledge in
England? Want of scriptural knowledge indeed in England!
Have not millions of money, been subscribed for the printing of
the scriptures, have not millions of bibles, been printed and circulated
in England? In short has not almost every one a bible,
to which he confidently appeals as his word of life? And yet
notwithstanding all this <i>warning</i> against Catholicity, notwithstanding
this immense diffusion of bibles in England, Catholicity
is rapidly increasing, to the great dismay and "horrification"
of our enemies. What then, can be the reason of this late
increase of Catholicity in England? Why, I will tell you, the
people of England, can now most of them read, and the march of
intellect is abroad, and by these means the people begin to find
out, that their Catholic fellow creatures, have been long, an
unjustly abused, a shamefully treated, and basely calumniated
body of Christians. The people, therefore, naturally begin to
feel for them, and are now unwilling to be deceived, by the idle
rant of those misinformed, but positive writers and preachers,
who</p>

<p>It is related in the Anglo-Saxon history, that when the Catholic
missionaries came from abroad, to announce the truths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_77" id="Addr_2_Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the Gospel to our pagan Anglo-Saxon ancestors, it is related that
an aged and venerable, but unconverted Thane thus addressed
his pagan prince on the subject. "When," said he, "O King,
you and your ministers are seated at table in the depth of
winter, and the cheerful fire blazes on the hearth in the middle
of the hall, a sparrow perhaps, chased by the wind and snow,
enters at one door of the apartment, and escapes by the other.
During the moment of its passage, it enjoys the warmth; when
it is once departed, it is seen no more. Such is the nature of
man. During a few years his existence is visible: but what has
preceded, or what will follow it, is concealed from the view of
mortals. If the new religion, offer any information on subjects
so mysterious and important, it must be worthy of our attention."
(Ling. His. Anglo-Sax. vol. i. pp. 29-30.) Happy shall
I consider myself, O Englishmen, if in the above pages, I have
advanced anything, that may be thought worthy of your attention
on the subject of religion. Our lives, as this pagan, but
aged and venerable Thane justly observes, are beautifully pictured
by the short flight of a sparrow, flying through the narrow
space of a hall, with a door open at each end. But after this
short passage of life, there is something most awful, and mysterious
awaiting us, and the true religion of God, only can unfold
to us, how we may best prepare ourselves for the revelation of
those awful moments, when time shall end, and eternity begin.
Surely then, the sincere search after the true religion, must be
a subject worthy of your information, of your attention, and of
your frequent consideration. Happy, again I repeat it, shall I
consider myself, if anything that I may have said, shall tend to
assist you in the above important, and essential investigation.
Refer, however, the glory and honour, not to me, but to the holy
Catholic Church, under whose guidance I have been instructed.
O holy Church, the pillar of truth and the child of Jesus Christ,
if I stray from thine unerring word, I shall soon (a weak and
frail child of Adam) fall down the awful precipice of spiritual
inconsistencies, contradictions, and errors. Should I have
advanced anything contrary to any article of thy holy faith, I
am ready publicly to recall it. Under the safe shelter of thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Addr_2_Page_78" id="Addr_2_Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
unerring authority, I will fix my resting-place, and there, fear
neither the scoffs of the infidel, nor the flimsy reasoning of those,
who have unfortunately strayed from thy secure paths. O Englishmen,
if you would only seriously, and conscientiously examine
the <i>real</i> merits of the Catholic Church, you would soon find that
she is built upon the pillar of truth, and that she is the admirable
work of that wise builder, Jesus Christ, who built His
house upon a firm foundation. "And the rains fell, and the
floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat on that house,
but it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock." (St. Matt.
vii. 25.)</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_H_8" id="Footnote_H_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_H_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> In the preceding pages, I have asserted, that the Protestant Church, is
unjust, in taking from the poor their portion of church property, which was
left them by our charitable Catholic ancestors; nay, that it is also unjust, to
exact tithes from those, who do not belong to the Protestant Church of England.
Now this bold assertion against the Protestant Church, certainly
requires a little explanation. A law may be considered in <i>two</i> points of view,
as a law of the <i>land</i>, and as a law of <i>God</i>. Now as the law of tithes in the
Protestant Church, is sanctioned by act of parliament, of course the Protestant
Church, is justified in exacting these tithes, for it has the law of the land
at <i>its back in this respect</i>. But then, the Protestant law of tithes, considered
in a <i>moral</i> point of view, is certainly an unjust law. And why? Because it
takes from the poor, what was <i>justly</i> left them by our charitable ancestors,
and it exacts money from the Catholics and dissenters, without doing any
thing to them <i>in return</i> for this money. Thus you see, that the law of <i>man</i>
and the law of <i>God</i>, sometimes <i>contradict</i> each other; and this is <i>often</i> the
case, in your scriptural Church as by law established. But is not <i>God</i>
<i>always</i> above <i>man</i>? Certainly; and therefore the <i>law</i> of <i>God</i>, ought <i>always</i> to
have the preference to the <i>law</i> of <i>man</i>. But this subject of Church tithes,
reminds me of the famous Dr. Hook of Leeds, who is <i>often writing</i> against the
Roman Catholic Church, but slyly <i>never</i> condescends to <i>answer</i> any of her
replies. Now, <i>mark well</i>, I am going to prove, <i>even to a demonstration</i>, from
the words of Dr. Hook, that the Roman Catholic Church, is <i>really</i> the <i>true</i>
Church of <i>Christ</i> in <i>these realms</i>. Well, you will say, if you <i>can</i> do <i>that</i>, Dr.
Hook must be a <i>very strange</i> and <i>inconsistent</i> doctor of our Church. Really,
do you know, I was just thinking the same. In the year 1832, the Somerset
County Gazette informed the public, that Dr. Hook, in a sermon which he
preached <i>before the Queen</i>, uttered the following <i>remarkable</i> words: "Were
all connection between church and state, at this very moment to cease, the
church (that is, the Protestant Church) would remain <i>precisely</i> as she <i>now</i>
is; that is to say, our bishops, though deprived of <i>temporal</i> rank, would still
exercise all those <i>spiritual</i> functions which, conferred by higher than human
authority, no human authority can take away; still to vacant sees they would
consecrate new bishops, still ordain the clergy, still confirm the baptized,
still govern the church." Such are the famous words of Dr. Hook, in his sermon
before the Queen. Now let us see how <i>nicely</i>, they <i>prove</i> the <i>Roman
Catholic Church</i>, to be the <i>true</i> Church of Christ in these realms. Whether
this prophecy of Dr. Hook respecting the <i>Protestant</i> Church, would be <i>really</i>
verified, were his church to be <i>separated</i> from the state, I will not here
enquire; but <i>this</i> I will say, it has been already really verified with regard to
the <i>Catholic</i> Church <i>in England</i>. For although at the Reformation, the <i>Catholic</i>
Church was deprived of all aid from the state, although she was unjustly
spoiled of those temporal riches left by her charitable children, and although
the exercise of her faith, subjected her followers to the most <i>severe pains</i> and
<i>penalties</i>, (which must be for ever a disgrace to this country), still, Catholicity
could not be extinguished in these kingdoms; for her bishops "<i>still continued</i>
to exercise all those <i>spiritual</i> functions, which, conferred by <i>higher</i> than
<i>human</i> authority, no human authority can take away, <i>still</i>, to <i>vacant</i> sees,
they consecrated new bishops, <i>still</i> ordained the clergy, <i>still</i> confirmed the
baptized, <i>still</i> governed the church." And hence this <i>Catholic</i> Church, notwithstanding
all the <i>stormy trials</i>, which she has undergone <i>in England</i>, exists
now, and is exactly the same in spiritual power, as she was before the time of the
Reformation. If, therefore, Dr. Hook considers that <i>this</i> would be a <i>mark</i> of
the <i>true</i> Church of Christ, were it to be <i>verified</i> with regard to his <i>Protestant</i>
Church, we may <i>justly</i> infer, according to the <i>Doctor's</i> principle, that the
<i>Roman Catholic</i> Church, is the <i>true</i> Church <i>of Christ in these realms</i>. And
why? Because the doctor's principle, has been <i>already really verified</i>, with
regard to <i>this</i> church in these kingdoms. Really, I begin to think that the
<i>famous</i> Dr. Hook of Leeds, must be some relation to Martin Luther; for
Martin, <i>even</i> after he had left the Catholic Church, proves, in the following
words, that the <i>Roman</i> Catholic Church, was the <i>true</i> Church of <i>Christ</i>. In
his book against the Anabaptists, he makes the following <i>candid</i> confession:
"Under Papacy are many good things; yea, <i>everything</i> that is <i>good</i> in Christianity.
I say, moreover," continues he, "under Papacy is <i>true</i> christianity
even the <i>very kernel</i> of christianity." Here we have two doctors of the
Protestant Church, leaving, <i>even after</i> they had strained every nerve to <i>overturn</i>
this Catholic Church, we have, I repeat, these two Protestant doctors,
leaving in their writings to posterity, <i>one</i> by his line of <i>argumentation</i>, and
the <i>other</i> by his <i>own</i> words, the most incontestible proofs that the Roman
Catholic Church, is <i>really</i> the <i>true</i> Church of <i>Christ</i>, and that her fabric, is
adorned with all the rich treasures of christianity. O how true is the declaration
of the wise man! (Prov. xxi. 30,) "there is no wisdom, there is no prudence,
there is no counsel against the Lord."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_I_9" id="Footnote_I_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_I_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> Joseph Hume, Esq., is, or nearly I believe, the oldest member of the present
House of Commons, and it may be <i>truly</i> said, that, perhaps, no one in
that House has acted with <i>greater</i> consistency, and more <i>disinterested</i> zeal,
for the promotion of the welfare of his country. He has <i>always</i> been a staunch
advocate for reform, a patriot for the rights of the poor, and a manly defender
of civil, and religious liberty <i>to all</i>. Hence, poor Dan. O'Connell, was sensible
of the <i>distinguished</i> political merits of this <i>great</i>, and consistent statesman;
and hence, when an <i>English</i> constituency rejected this worthy member from
a seat in the House, Dan. <i>honourably</i> obtained in <i>Ireland</i> a seat for <i>this useful
and consistent</i> member. Now, I am glad to find, that the <i>remarks</i> which I
have just made, agree with the opinion of <i>this eminent</i> statesman, <i>respecting
the loaves and fishes of the protestant clergy</i>. The following, are the words
which Joseph Hume, Esq. has <i>just</i> uttered on this subject: "but their zeal
(that is, the zeal of the protestant clergy,) against the Catholics, looks to me,
to originate from <i>fear</i> of the <i>loaves</i> and <i>fishes</i>, which they now so <i>largely</i>
enjoy for doing <i>little</i>, and in <i>many</i> cases <i>nothing</i> of public duty." (Joseph
Hume's, Esq., letter to W. J. Cole, Esq., Lechdale, Gloucestershire, 24th
Dec., 1850.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_J_10" id="Footnote_J_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_J_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> I cannot help relating here a circumstance (I hope it is not foreign to the
purpose) that happened to one of my acquaintance. He was travelling in a
coach, in which were three other respectable passengers. Among other subjects,
the conversation (as is often the case) turned on Catholics. One of the
gentlemen, immediately commenced a philippic against the Catholics, and
called them idolaters, superstitious, murderers, and many other <i>pretty</i> names.
My acquaintance allowed the gentleman, to pour out his abuse for some time
<i>without interruption</i>, and appeared much amused by his bold assertions, and
flaming descriptions of the poor <i>deluded</i> papists. During the conversation, a
person in liquor, rode up to the coach window, and began to annoy the passengers,
by his yells and impertinent behaviour. My acquaintance immediately
said to the gentleman, who was telling such pretty things about the
Catholics, let us have this drunken man taken up, he has murdered two or
three people. The gentleman replied, "Are you, Sir, <i>certain</i> that he <i>has</i>
murdered two or three people? Can you <i>prove it</i>? Because it would be very
<i>unjust</i> to take the man up, unless you could <i>prove</i> the crimes which you mention."
"No," answered my acquaintance, "I am not certain. And let me
ask you, if <i>you</i> are <i>certain</i>, that all the charges, which you have just brought
against the <i>Catholics</i> are <i>true</i>? I am a Catholic, and must tell you they are
<i>false</i>, and if <i>you</i> would only follow the advice, which you have just given <i>me</i>
about this man, you would find the truth of what I say. If <i>you</i> would not
wish <i>me</i> to accuse this man of a crime, which I am not certain he <i>has</i> committed,
I beg that <i>you</i>, for the future, will <i>never</i> accuse the <i>Catholics</i> of
charges, which <i>you</i> cannot <i>prove</i> to be true, and which, if you would only
take the trouble to examine, you would find to be <i>absolutely false</i>." The
gentleman looked <i>much perplexed</i>, and was so ashamed of himself, that he
never spoke another word until they parted. The other two gentlemen
<i>enjoyed the joke wonderfully, and laughed most heartily</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_K_11" id="Footnote_K_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_K_11"><span class="label">[K]</span></a> We read of the ancient prophets, whom God sent to reform the Jews
that they began their prophecies by admonishing the people, that the Lord
had spoken to them: "Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the
Lord hath spoken." Isai, c. i. v. 2. Whereas God has permitted that the
doctrine of the Reformation, should have been originally announced to the
world, by a man of insupportable pride, who disclaimed the authority, and
doctrine of all Churches then upon the earth; who made no difficulty of
acknowledging, that it was from <i>the devil</i>, he learned <i>one</i> of the principal
articles of the Reformation, and who might therefore, have said to his followers,
"Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the <i>devil</i> hath spoken."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_L_12" id="Footnote_L_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_L_12"><span class="label">[L]</span></a> But some will perhaps ask, why did the <i>first</i> reformers inveigh <i>so much</i>
against <i>Purgatory</i> and <i>Prayers for the dead</i>? Why the first reformers liked
<i>spiritual</i> commerce, <i>without</i> duty if they could only contrive it. Now, as a
remuneration for Prayers for the dead, our charitable ancestors had left certain
handsome sums of money; now these reformers liked the <i>money</i>, but <i>not</i> the
<i>obligation</i> of the Prayers; and, therefore, they inveighed <i>right lustily against</i>
the Prayers, but took care to slyly pocket the money. But when this spiritual
commerce could <i>not</i> be carried on unless the duty was <i>performed</i>, they very
kindly retained the popish practice, and thus secured the money; witness the
tolling of the bell for persons <i>just</i> dead, the churching of females, and of
burying the dead. These and other are in reality the remnants of popish
ceremonies, and the performance of them inspire on the <i>Catholic</i> mind <i>devotional</i>
feelings; but by Protestants are, <i>in general</i>, looked upon very lightly,
in a <i>spiritual</i> point of view. But then take away these popish ceremonies,
and off flies the fee. Will the fee for baptism be now demanded, as baptism
has been <i>lately</i> declared to be an unnecessary act of religion in the Protestant
Church? Our Saviour said to His Apostles, "Go, teach all nations, <i>baptizing</i>
them," (that is, all nations,) but the Protestant Church says to her ministers,
"Go teach all nations," but as to the <i>absolute necessity</i> of baptism, our
Saviour <i>must</i> have been wrong, and, therefore, go please yourselves about it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_N_14" id="Footnote_N_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_N_14"><span class="label">[N]</span></a> Would my Lord Harewood, who <i>lately</i> figured so conspicuously on the
platform in York, as the advocate for the pure and unadulterated Word of
God, without note or comment, point out to the people <i>the sure guide</i>, which
they are to follow, amidst this <i>awful Protestant</i> falsification, and mutilation
of the Sacred Scriptures? The Spanish chemist (as related above) cut his
master into pieces, and put the pieces into his sublimatory glass, with the
hope of raising his master, to a more perfect state than he enjoyed, when God
made him. Now, my Lord, from what I have said above, has not the Protestant
Church, cut the Scriptures into pieces, and put them into the sublimatory
glass of falsification and mutilation? but, my Lord, will she be ever able
to raise them again, to as perfect a state as they were in, when God made
them, or when your Protestant Church received them, from the hands of the
Catholic Church? I am sure, my Lord, she will be here at <i>fault</i>. Another
remark or two, my Lord, and I have done. The man, who embraces a religious
opinion from conviction, has undoubtedly the right to maintain it by
argument. But truth will be his first and principal object, and the champion
of truth, will disdain the petty artifices of substituting assertion for truth,
and misrepresentation for fact. He will never condescend to swell the
crowd of idle disputants, whose ingenuity first, frames a creed for the Church
of Rome, and then, after combatting a phantom of its own creation, exults in
an easy and a decisive victory. My Lord, just adopt this advice in all your
<i>future</i> observations on the creed of Catholics, and then, you will escape two
ridiculous consequences; of exalting the Scriptures on the one hand, and of
transgressing on the other, one of the golden precepts of that sacred volume,
"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour." But far be it
from me, my Lord, to <i>assert</i> that you have <i>already done</i> this. I merely wish
to guard your Lordship, against the above ridiculous consequences. Now, as
your ideas, with regard to the <i>Catholic</i> doctrine on the Scriptures, appear to
be rather vague, I will just state, in short, our doctrine on that subject. Our
Saviour commanded his apostles to go and preach his gospel, and after they
had done this for a certain time, he then inspired some of them to write certain
books, for the fuller instruction of those persons on certain points, which
they either did not perfectly understand, or of which they were ignorant.
For, as the apostles were absent from these persons, (for twelve men could
not be in many places at the same time,) they found it necessary to communicate
by their pens, certain instructions which these persons required.
Now, as what the apostles <i>wrote</i>, as well as what they <i>preached</i>, was <i>equally</i>
the inspired Word of God, the Catholic Church, afterwards, carefully collected
those sacred books, which were written by some of these inspired men,
gave to the whole of these sacred books thus collected, the name of the New
Testament, and presented this volume to the people as the inspired Word of
God, and has handed it down as such to her faithful in every age, in as perfect
a manner as possible. And in the distribution of it to her faithful in
every age, she has followed the example of the apostles. For she orders her
ministers to go <i>first</i>, to preach and teach the gospel to the people, and <i>afterwards</i>,
for their further instruction, she puts the sacred Scriptures into the
hands of the faithful. But mind, as your Protestant Reformers have <i>shamefully</i>
corrupted and mutilated the sacred Scriptures, she rejects your human
and metamorphosed translations, forbids the use of your incorrect, corrupt,
and mutilated translations, and puts into their hands, <i>well-authenticated</i>
copies of that sacred volume. Hence, on account of her <i>great anxiety</i>, for
the distribution of <i>correct</i>, and <i>well-authenticated</i> copies among her faithful,
certain Protestants have the <i>audacity</i> to assert, that the Catholic Church, forbids
the use of the Scripture to her people, or at least, will not let them read
the pure word of God without note or comment. Do I impeach the veracity
of these Protestants! Of some indeed I do, but not of all. But this I will
say, most of them might know better, if they would only seek information
from proper sources. I hope, this short explanation of the <i>Catholic</i> doctrine
on the Scripture, will satisfy Lord Harewood, and caution him never to speak
on matters, which <i>essentially</i> concern <i>his neighbour's</i> interest, <i>unless</i> he <i>first</i>
perfectly understands them.
</p><p>
One word more, and I have done. I once heard, that a Noble Lord, attending
a great County Meeting, in the York Castle-yard, had achieved for himself
a lasting notoriety, by declaring, that in his opinion, "the Bible ought to
be read by all men, and women, and children, and <i>even idiots</i>. And scarcely
had the merriment excited by this memorable burst of sound sense subsided,
before his Lordship was heard thus resuming his exhilarating eloquence.
"Yes, even by idiots. I myself have derived great advantage from that
book." The effect upon the meeting was electric. The noble advocate of
the unfortunate idiots, had so completely identified himself with his clients, that
laughter became irresistible, and to what class of intelligent beings, his Lordship
belonged, most evident. I believe this is the only instance on record,
of a Noble Earl, establishing his religious opinions, at the expense of his
understanding.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_O_15" id="Footnote_O_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_O_15"><span class="label">[O]</span></a> Here follows a long extract from Lord Tenterden's Speech, which it is
unnecessary to reprint.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_P_16" id="Footnote_P_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_P_16"><span class="label">[P]</span></a> By the fundamental rule of Protestantism, every individual, possesses the
right of private judgment, and of course, is allowed to interpret the Bible, as
his reason, or his feelings, suggest; and yet, <i>mark</i> the contradiction, he is <i>not</i>
allowed, to interpret the <i>thirty-nine Articles</i>. For in the declaration prefixed
to this singular code, it is said: "His Majesty, prohibits his loving subjects,
the least difference from them, or putting their <i>own</i> sense upon them; but
requires them, to be taken in <i>their literal</i>, and <i>grammatical</i> sense." Now, Dr.
Paley says, that "the Thirty-nine Articles, will be found, on dissection, to
contain about two hundred and forty <i>distinct</i>, and independent propositions;
many of them, inconsistent with <i>each</i> other." In fact, few of the English
Clergy subscribe the articles in the literal, and grammatical sense; "and
Burnet says, that in his own times, the greater part of the clergy, subscribed
the Articles, <i>without examining them</i>," and that others do it, because they
<i>must</i> do it, <i>though they can hardly satisfy their consciences</i>, about some things in
them. Dr. Balguy says, that "the Thirty-nine Articles impose upon us doctrines
of dark, and ignorant ages." How just, then, must the observation of
Gibbon be, "that the great body of the English Clergy, sign the Thirty-nine
Articles, with a <i>sigh</i>, or a <i>smile</i>." Really, to require that men, should take
these Articles, in their literal, and grammatical sense, whilst many of them,
have <i>no literal</i>, or <i>grammatical</i> sense, nay, moreover, to oblige men, to swear
that they believe them, is, in my humble opinion, a violation of common
sense, and of decency. In all this, there may be some degree of political wisdom,
but it is surely, an act of very gross, religious inconsistency.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_Q_17" id="Footnote_Q_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_Q_17"><span class="label">[Q]</span></a> The name of Ireland, brings to my mind, the great O'Connell, the pride of
his country, the wonder of England, and the admiration of the world. When
I read the direful grievances of that ill-treated nation, I wish, for the sake of
England, (which I dearly love) that those grievances had never been written,
either on the pages of history, or on the records of heaven. Oh, Ireland, how
thou remindest me of the sufferings of my Saviour! "a man of sorrow, and
the outcast of the people." Had not <i>his</i> divine example been continually
before <i>thy eyes</i>, thou never couldst have endured thy load of miseries, of
sorrows, and of persecution, and so nobly have proved thy loyal allegiance to
thy sovereign, even amidst a deluge of insults, and of wrongs, and of
injustices, that would have maddened any other nation, into a whirlwind of
fury, and revenge, and rebellion; but thou rememberedst the words of thy
Saviour, "love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and persecute
you." But thy days of sufferings and of sorrow are, I hope, hastening to a
close; but perhaps, the time of retribution for England has yet to come. Oh,
may Heaven avert this dreadful day of reckoning for my dear country! But,
Oh, Ireland, I must not forget the pride of thy heart&mdash;the great O'Connell&mdash;the
much-abused and calumniated Dan. He is now, indeed, beyond this
land of misery; but alas, he died a beggar! Yes, <span class="small">HE</span> whom the newspapers
<i>formerly</i> held up, as a <i>most base knave</i>, a <i>deceiver</i>, and a <i>money-hunter</i>, <i>even he</i>
at last, died a beggar, for the <i>love</i> of his country. He nobly sacrificed his, from
ten to fourteen thousand a year, which he was making by his profession, and
in lieu, accepted the comparatively small and precarious offerings of his countrymen,
every farthing of which he spent in promoting their welfare; he
blasted all the patrimonial prospects of his own family, and at last, died
a martyr and a beggar, for his country; and yet, there is not one English
Protestant newspaper to do him common justice, by <i>even hinting</i> at these
<i>heroic</i> actions. Oh, how justly may I address them in the severe words of
the poet:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You all did hate him once, but without cause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men have lost their reason."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, Oh immortal Dan! their praises or censures to thee are equally
worthless, for thy colossal deeds during life, and thy heroic death, have
immortalized thy name. But of all thy sorrows, the <i>stab</i> that <i>burst</i> thy generous
soul, was the "<i>unkindest cut of all</i>;" for when some of thy countrymen,
whom thou hadst <i>raised and honoured</i>, wished to take into their hands the
maddening weapons of injustice, revenge, and rebellion, and wished to bury
thy dear country in the ruins of bloodshed and revolution, thou,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then rushing out of doors, to be resolved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If these men so unkindly knocked, or no,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quite vanquished thee, then burst thy noble heart!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On which was engraved, in vivid characters, love for thy religion,
patriotism for thy country, loyal and sincere allegiance to thy Queen, and a
burning desire for civil and religious liberty for all mankind. Oh, how justly
may we apply to thee, the words of the poet,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou art the ruins, of the noblest man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ever lived, in the tide of times."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I, formerly, like many other Englishmen, thought only very lightly of thy
actions; but thy noble deeds convinced me of my <i>rash</i> judgment; and
as some little retribution, I have paid this small tribute to thy memory. Oh,
may God forgive me for my rash judgments, and may thy colossal soul rest
in peace.
</p><p>
But can I here forget "the finest Protestant (as the immortal Dan. justly
observed) that Ireland ever saw?" O no! I know indeed, some will sneer
at it, and call it the voice of flattery, but in the eyes of poor Ireland, it will
be regarded as a just act of gratitude, to remember the liberal, the high-minded,
and chivalrous nobleman, the Marquis of Normanby. When this
kind hearted, and enlightened statesman, first placed his foot on the shores
of Ireland, "the cauldron" (of political discords) as Lord Plunkett had said,
"was boiling over, and the polemic (religious) contest was thrown in as an
ingredient." But as soon as the Marquis of Normanby, hoisted in Ireland
his political flag of truth, of justice, and of honour, then the cauldron (of political
discord,) gradually cooled, and the polemic (religious) contest gradually
subsided, into the more congenial calm of peace, of union, and of charity.
Hence, might be seen the noble Marquis of Normanby, and his charitable
marchioness, gracing, and gladdening by their presence the streets of Dublin,
unattended by military escorts, but <i>safely</i> guarded, by the generous hearts,
and faithful loyalty of a grateful people. To have touched even a single hair
of their heads, or to have offered the least insult to these noble, and generous
creatures, would have instantly brought down on the base offender, the indignation
and fury of the people. There the noble Marquis, without any detriment
to his political dignity, walked without guards, surrounded by the
hearts of the people, an honour to England, a just representative of our most
gracious, liberal, and well-beloved Queen, the idol of the people, and the
saviour of Ireland. But why mention merely Ireland? His <i>whole</i> political
career, has been a consistent course of truth, of justice, and of honour. When
only young, the golden prospect of Tory promotion, the inheritance of his
noble father's political influence, a seat in Parliament already obtained by a
Tory constituency, were all laid before him; when lo! his penetrating
though youthful mind, saw that his dear country required reform, and therefore,
sacrificing all the above golden prospects, he disinterestedly ranked
himself, under the banner of reform. Afterwards a sinecure, but profitable
office under Government, was offered him by the Whig ministry; but his
political creed, was reform and consistency, and therefore, he politely
declined the tempting offer. He is afterwards honoured with the government
of Jamaica, and there shews himself the sincere friend of the slave, and
on one occasion, generously and manfully exposed even his own life, to vindicate
and obtain their just rights: and how dearly he was there beloved, the
sorrowful and sincere lamentations, that bade him the last farewell, can best
tell. He is honoured also, with the government of Ireland, and gradually
peace, contentment, and union, begun to smile on that long agitated, and
mis-ruled land. But in all his political promotions, to his honour be it remembered,
that he never solicits nor asks of Government any places of office
for his relations. Such has been the consistent and even tenor of his political
career. Long, will the name of Normanby, be dearly cherished, in the
heart of every sincere Catholic, of every grateful Irishman, and of every true
English reformer; and he will be handed down to posterity, as a worthy descendant
of the Mulgrave family, whose character has always been distinguished,
for their acts of justice, liberality, and charity to all, <i>without any distinction
of religious creeds</i>. Well then might the immortal Dan declare, that
"The Marquis of Normanby, was the finest Protestant, that Ireland ever
saw."</p></div>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
